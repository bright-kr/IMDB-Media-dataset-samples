"Smashing Through",,"[""Drama"",""Western""]","Dave Marco, a claim jumper, and his boss Earl Foster, a crooked investment broker, hire chemist Ralph Brandon to sign papers proclaiming the wealth of a certain mine. Foster then convinces Ralph's mother to invest all of her money in the mine, which actually is worthless. While she and her pretty daughter Holly are waiting in Foster's San Francisco office, they meet Jack Mason, whose rich mine has not yet earned him any profits, and the two young people fall in love. Inspecting her mine in Keno County, Mrs. Brandon learns that it is worthless, but when she confronts Foster, he threatens to have Ralph arrested for signing false documents unless Holly agrees to marry him. Meanwhile, Marco tries to jump Jack's claim but is prevented from doing so by Jack and a sheriff's posse. Foster weds Holly in an illegal ceremony, but Jack and Ralph overtake their train with the aid of a car and then a motorcycle. Finally, Ralph kills Foster, freeing Holly and her mother from his clutches.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166730/"",""name"":""Elmer Clifton""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940820/"",""name"":""Walter Woods""}],""title"":""Writer""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712660/"",""name"":""Herbert Rawlinson""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366457/"",""name"":""Neal Hart""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208659/"",""name"":""Sam De Grasse""}],""title"":""Stars""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0009624/mediaviewer/rm1546144256"",""name"":""Herbert Rawlinson in Smashing Through (1918)""}]","[{""actor"":""Herbert Rawlinson"",""character"":""Jack Mason"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712660""},{""actor"":""Neal Hart"",""character"":""Dave Marco"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366457""},{""actor"":""Sam De Grasse"",""character"":""Earl Foster"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208659""},{""actor"":""Millard K.

I didn&#39;t know if I was going to like the owl house. I thought for a second that it was going to be an OK show. But man was I wrong. The Owl house was one of the best shows I&#39;ve ever seen in awhile I had so many great things, beautiful Animation, Great LGBTQ represestation and overall an entertaining story. There is so much that could have happened for season 3 But disney said that and I quote &quot; the owl house did not fit the disney brand&quot;. This really sucks, and because of that, the our house was cut short to only three episodes. Although the third season was good there was so much Stuff that was missing. Watching and dreaming is one of the Best endings to a show I have ever seen. The final Battle had Beautiful animation. And the ending really make me sad. But I was happy that the characters got the ending they deserved. But one thing I do remember is that there were quite a few unanswered questions. But the creator said that she would love to make a spin off In the future.

It is a tale that relates of a vagabond who decides to investigate the ostensible suicide of his younger brother despite having to deal with rude demeanor from a community that avoids giving answers to his probing queries. Frank Reade (Michael O&#39;Keefe), an aimless rover of sorts, returns to his home town in order to attend funeral services for his younger brother Jimmy, apparently a suicide. His incidental attempts to learn what was behind Jimmy&#39;s passing are obstructed by his friends and by his own father (John Seitz), all while Jimmy&#39;s somewhat emotionally disturbed girl friend Jolene (Bridget Fonda) attaches herself to an initially resistant Frank; however, her enigmatic remarks to him eventually contain a special significance that lead him to believe that his brother&#39;s death may have been a homicide. When Frank delves into possible causes of the fatal event, he unsheathes a tangle of illicit activity involving narcotics that has engaged both Jimmy and his father, in addition to discovering an incestuous relationship that has snared Jolene and, largely as a result of a corrupt local sheriff, it becomes quite plain that Frank Reade&#39;s stay in the town will be for a much longer period than was anticipated by him. Most of the film&#39;s players are at least competent, with O&#39;Keefe gathering in the acting honours with an intense performance as a loner who finds himself over his head in a struggle with townspeople who are not inclined to wish the best for him. Fonda creates her role of Jolene with skill despite its being a rather underwritten part. Although the scenario hastens to a maladroit conclusion, director Winick and those others responsible for post-production editing have united to establish the work&#39;s noteworthy pacing, and the camera skills of Makato Watanabe visually the captures the enervated character of an industrial community in decline. Scoring by Yaltkaya, albeit deceptively modest, has received first class sound editing to match the film&#39;s moody temper. Shot in upstate New York&#39;s Fulton County, largely in the small cities of Johnstown and Gloversville, this film can be recommended to those viewers interested in independent cinema, principally for its mood projection, as well as for its smooth narrative flow, until its rickety final scenes. It has not been released in a DVD format but is worth one&#39;s effort to locate as a VHS tape.","Jack comes back to town for his brothers funeral and finds things have changed.

The first person that the Skipper and Gilligan visit is the Professor, just as he delightedly demonstrates a new ready made guillotine! They find Ginger and Mary Ann in the process of boiling poison, supposedly to kill the mice around the huts. The Skipper initially scoffs at Gilligan&#39;s attempt to barricade the door against intruders, until he&#39;s reminded that until they were shipwrecked they &#39;didn&#39;t know any of these people!&#39; Suspicion grows among all seven, but credibility is stretched when Mr. Howell, the Professor, and both Ginger and Mary Ann all claim to have known the murder victim, who turns out to have been a real scoundrel. The denouement is the only one possible, with poor Gilligan in the role of Randolph Blake in a Perry Mason-style reenactment of the crime.","The castaways discover that they are all wanted for questioning in a murder that took place right before they left Hawaii.The castaways discover that they are all wanted for questioning in a murder that took place right before they left Hawaii.",,"tt0588088"

It&#39;s not as entertaining and fun as Director Henry Richardson&#39;s most recent film &#39;Hayfever&#39;, but if you prefer to be creeped out rather than thrilled and grossed out, give this found footage a chance.","A videographer buys some cheap cameras from a car boot sale but gets more than what he bargained for when the cameras contain footage of a documentary about a local urban legend that quickly turns sinister.A videographer buys some cheap cameras from a car boot sale but gets more than what he bargained for when the cameras contain footage of a documentary about a local urban legend that quickly turns sinister.",,"tt19042674"

She is not alone in the last quality, as her supervisor, Gigi Ballista, cannot make anything work in his office, whether it is the water cooler or the telephone.Those, combined with every man she meets wanting to rape her, are the primary jokes in this very low-brow but funny Italian farce.

The magic of the film however, is in its ability to artlessly translate a restoring and comforting warmth in the face of such a despairing content. I was left feeling truly grateful to have had the privilege to have seen the film and learn about some of the wonderful people in it. As a study, this documentary offers immediate proximity to people facing a part of life we must all face; death. And that is not an easy subject for most any of us to grasp or make sense of, no matter how much experience we have had with it. What would you do if you learned that you were incurably ill? Given a rapidly approaching deadline, a deadline you thought you wouldn&#39;t have to think about in such a manufactured light... not like this; not right now. How would you cope with being told that your body would soon vigorously, unapologetically and almost certainly painfully, deteriorate and part with... everything. Now, what would you do if you were able to take back some control in the matter of your life. And if this were possible, what would it even mean? This documentary addresses the option of physician-assisted suicide which is a matter quite different from euthanasia, (where a doctor is ultimately in control of the procedure) but it is certainly no less controversial. Physician-assisted suicide is a move towards giving terminally ill persons a choice; a choice they, and they alone, can legally make. An individual of sound mind, (who has appropriate witness signatures to report so), is allowed as much consideration and independence as possible in determining when and how they are to exit this world and their illness. It is the patient themselves who is to administer the substance which results in their death, and this is something revolutionary in the western world today. Whether you agree or disagree with the medical, moral, or political advances in this film should not influence your decision to watch it. Rather, I strongly encourage you to add this to your watch list for two reasons: firstly, for its relatable and engaging accounts and the people you will get to meet, and secondly for its skill as a piece of film-making. If you are a lover of exceptional cinema, especially documentaries, you will not be disappointed.Hopefully you will leave &#39;How to Die in Oregon&#39; with an enhanced perception and tangibility of not only death and dying, but more importantly humanity, and what this means to each and everyone of us. An easy 10/10 for me,Boogie","In 1994 Oregon became the first state to legalize a terminally ill person's request to end his or her life with medication.

Documentary director Mami Sunada shadowed the animation director as he created his latest work – When the Wind Rises. Sunada seemed to have full access to the studio and home of the director, taping company meetings, interviewing and recording some of the 400 employees at work at the Ghibli Studio in west Tokyo. Interspersed in the latest development of the script and creation process were the complicated relationship, partnership and friendship between Miyazaki and Isao Takahada, who bought Miyazaki into the field of animation years ago. He was directing the animation The Tale of Princess Kaguya which was scheduled to show in Japan the same year as When the Wind Rises. Never to be missed was the portrayal of micro- managing producer Toshio Suzuki who had been working between the two giants for more than half of a century. It is moving watching archive footages of these three young men working closely for and dedicated more than half of their lives to this field. Long terms friends and work partners, they have gradually grown into three graceful yet a little stubborn artists. You cannot help but admire their respect for their passion. Also valuable was how candid Miyazaki was in front of the camera, revealing his philosophy, emotions, contradiction, hesitation and imagination. At 72, he is still lively and fun as a child and dreams of all kind of crazy ideas. Excellent editing here to insert clips of the animation which made his dreams come true. We also see his deepest respect for life and ordinary things around him. In many ways, he reminds me of the grandfather in Heidi: A Girl from the Alps, directed by Takahata in 1974, particularly when Miyazaki has his apron on almost all the time.I watched this after visiting the exhibition on Studio Ghibli Layout Designs: Understanding the secrets of Takahata and Miyazaki Animation at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. It was much less interesting than the visit to the Ghibli Studio in Tokyo but the exhibit offered a closer look at some of the tediously detailed hand-drawn artwork which I later saw in this film. Similar to Miyazaki&#39;s animation work, the studio was warm and filled with natural light. The work style is informal, fun and loving though Miyazaki can be hard to work with at times. It looks like a fun place to work. Now, having learned more about how Miyazaki created his various animation works, I would sure watch his work again in new lights.",,,"tt3204392"

Sam makes an ideal foe for Bugs, as his temper lends itself to all manner of situations.  Elmer makes a good foil, as it makes sense why a hunter would want to shoot a rabbit, but Sam opens up many more possibilities.  Interestingly, one of the more effectively utilized characters in the more recent shorts made in the 1990s is Sam.  Here the action centers around a property dispute and sight gags and verbal wordplay are both in abundance and a great time is had by all.  Good to see it&#39;s available.  Well worth watching.

Carter's new girlfriend Julie Kingdom and her colleague Mike Seton, both young uniformed rookie cops, go out on a limb to pursue a known fence, and recover the brandy. However, Regan is into damage limitation and wants to take the credit for himself, putting him at odds with Carter.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0165965/"",""name"":""Tom Clegg""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0157595/"",""name"":""Ted Childs""}],""title"":""Writer""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857177/"",""name"":""John Thaw""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913993/"",""name"":""Dennis Waterman""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265189/"",""name"":""Kate Fahy""}],""title"":""Stars""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0714430/mediaviewer/rm55518465"",""name"":""John Thaw in Drag Act (1978)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0714430/mediaviewer/rm2993431809"",""name"":""Kate Fahy and Dennis Waterman in The Sweeney (1975)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0714430/mediaviewer/rm2691441921"",""name"":""Kate Fahy and Dennis Waterman in The Sweeney (1975)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0714430/mediaviewer/rm1349264641"",""name"":""Patrick Malahide, John Thaw, and Dennis Waterman in The Sweeney (1975)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0714430/mediaviewer/rm2513380609"",""name"":""The Sweeney (1975)""}]","[{""actor"":""John Thaw"",""character"":""Regan"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857177""},{""actor"":""Dennis Waterman"",""character"":""Carter"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913993""},{""actor"":""Kate Fahy"",""character"":""WPC Julie Kingdom"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265189""},{""actor"":""Albert Welling"",""character"":""PC Mike Seton"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919979""},{""actor"":""Benjamin Whitrow"",""character"":""Det.

The plan is to turn the cozy rustic lodge into a ski resort, which is news to the family selling it. Stephanie spends the week before Christmas with the family, experiencing the holiday their way. If you think she&#39;ll fall for the handsome son (Jesse Hutch) and have a change of heart about Christmas, you must have seen a Hallmark movie before.I&#39;m always down for a good Candace Cameron Bure TV movie, especially a Christmas one. She&#39;s the same here as she is in every role: pretty, charming, likable. Alan Thicke is good as her not-so-likable dad. The fact that Thicke used to play Candace&#39;s brother Kirk&#39;s father on Growing Pains no doubt led to some back-patting for whoever cast him. Jesse Hutch is an actor whose face is very recognizable if you watch much TV, even if you can&#39;t remember where exactly you&#39;ve seen him before. He&#39;s been a guest-star on just about everything that films in Canada. This is one of the bigger roles I&#39;ve seem him in. He does well and has nice chemistry with Candace. Their meet-cute is funny. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing him in more starring roles. Dan Willmott and Gabrielle Rose are his salt of the earth parents. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to dislike them. Oh, and just to preserve it for posterity in case someone changes it: Jesse Hutch&#39;s IMDb bio currently brags that he shares a birthplace with fictional comic book character Wolverine and tells a rather odd anecdote about him faking a hostage situation at his high school. Weird but amusing.The Canadian scenery (subbing for Maine) is lovely. The cast is pleasant and fun. The story is predictable but who cares really? This isn&#39;t challenging stuff but it is enjoyable. It has humor, romance, and heartwarming family moments. It&#39;s a better than average Christmas TV movie that will make you smile.","A self-defined Grinch, Stephanie begins her stay at Snow Valley Lodge immune to Christmas sentiment. But as the lodge's festive traditions provide the Christmas Stephanie never had growing up with her distant father, Stephanie finds herself enjoying every minute. To complicate her professional duties even further, the combative feelings she felt toward Brady turn into romantic ones. With Stephanie's newfound Christmas spirit and unexpected holiday romance, she begins to question Falcon's overhaul. As her Christmas Eve deadline approaches, she's faced with a decision: should she transform the lodge into a new winter hot spot or embrace tradition and let it snow? —Anonymous",,"tt3320502"

This narrative choice not only broke the momentum built up until that point but also shattered the drama&#39;s coherence. After this abrupt twist, the series struggled to regain its footing, and the attempts to recover its initial momentum proved futile, leading to a disjointed narrative and a noticeable decline in quality. While attempting to portray the struggles of the oppressed, the series fell into repetitive cycles, as expected. The romantic elements felt forced and superficial. Rather than enhancing the storyline, the romantic subplot felt out of place and failed to integrate seamlessly into the overarching plot. It felt like they had to give the lead a girl, any girl. Would have been better if his siblings occupied that gap instead of being wasted on the love interest. At least the drama didn&#39;t end like Hong Gil Dong (2008).","There was a divisive figure in the Joseon Dynasty who was a hero to the people but an enemy to the establishment. His name was Hong Gil Dong. King Yeonsangun had royal lineage but was reviled by his people while Hong Gil Dong was born as a slave but succeeded in winning over the hearts of the commoners. The struggle between these two men demonstrate the qualities that a true leader needs. This TV series portrays the life of Hong Gil Dong who survived in a hostile and tyrannical kingdom as he waged a fight against the powerful elites.",,"tt6256694"

His superiors wished to see him devoting his energy back to crime investigations. Therefore they decided to assign him to Yangquan where his fiancee died out of a car accident.

And given the fact that I have had the movie in my movie Collection for close to 10 years also. But I finally got around to watching it.And with it now having been watched, I can say that this is a very generic Hong Kong comedy for the time it was made. With that in mind, don&#39;t get me wrong, because I am not stating that it is a bad movie. Just that it follows a very standard &#39;how-to-make-a-comedy&#39; recipe. And if you have seen just a few of the comedies from Hong Kong from the late Eighties, then you know what you are in for here.The story in &quot;Double Fattiness&quot; (aka &quot;Shuang fei lin men&quot;) is about Luk Siu-Fung (played by Lydia Shum) who owns and runs a pizza restaurant with her husband Mo Jup-shu (played by Bill Tung) and son Mo Tak-Go (played by Eric Tsang). They are being pressured into selling their lot in order for a company raise new buildings. Luk Siu-Fung dies from a heart attack and her spirit becomes reincarnated into the body of the young and beautiful Diana (played by Maggie Cheung).All in all, then it is a fun storyline that does offer the occasional wholehearted laugh here and there. But what makes the movie work is the cast list which included some good Hong Kong talents. And if you are familiar with the Hong Kong cinema, then the four main talents should be no strangers to you.But the generic nature of the movie makes it a bit too mundane, which was a shame. But hey, at least you know exactly what you are getting into.","Siu-Fung (Lydia Sum), an owner of a pizzeria, unexpectedly succumbs to a heart attack.

Of course, the studio also made many cartoons for the American government at that time.&quot;Boys Anti-Tank Rifle&quot; (also called &quot;Stop That Tank&quot;) was a film made in an effort to allay the fears of men who were given this anti-tank gun. That&#39;s because it had a terrible reputation and was only effective on light tanks. Heavily armored tanks simply were too difficult for the Boys to damage. So, the film uses a bit of humor and mostly cartoon simulations of the gun as well as live footage to explain its use as well as to insist that it IS effective and useful (which, in many instances, it wasn&#39;t).So is this film worth seeing?

It&#39;s extremely dark, violent, but has some comedic moments as well. The sountrack is so weird yet amazing and fits perfectly with the show. It&#39;s been over a year since I&#39;ve watched Utopia but there&#39;s not a day that goes by when I don&#39;t think about it. It hurts me knowing that people have not experienced this masterpiece. The show lasted only 2 seasons after being cancelled and although it ended on a cliffhanger, most of the show&#39;s story and character arcs were wrapped up which is fine. With only 6 episodes in each season, there&#39;s no filler and the plot always keeps moving forward.If I could recommend one show, it would be UTOPIA.",,,"tt2384811"

"Fall In",,"[""Comedy""]","Captain Gillis (Frank Faylen) puts Sergeant ""Dodo"" Doubleday (William Tracy), because of his photographic memory, on a candidates list for Officer's Training School ahead of Sergeant William Ames (Joe Sawyer), much to the dismay of Ames. The latter, in an effort to make Doubleday look bad, puts him in charge of the training of the Hatfield clan, a raw-to-the-max group of recruits from Kentucky. That they are all sharp-shooters does Doubleday no harm. Meanwhile, across town, a highly-respected citizen named Arnold Benedict (Clyde Filmore) and his tall squeeze Lydia (Rebel Randall) open up an in-house canteen for the soldiers. That Arnold is a German Spy comes as no great surprise to students of American history or Hal Roach films. Joan (Jean Porter), Dodo's girl friend (and ample proof that Dodo is smarter than he looks and acts), discovers that all the house-plants in the house are armed with listening devices feeding directly to the basement where most of Hollywood's German-actor colony (most under WWII assumed nom-de-plumes) are eavesdropping on the conversations of the soldiers. While Dodo and his MP band of Hatfields are cleaning out this nest of spies, Dodo hears a message on the short-wave announcing the locations and meeting places of all the 5th Column spy rings and, because of his photographic memory, there will be no problem passing this info onto Colonel Elliott (Robert Barrat.) And there wouldn't have been if Dodo hadn't got knocked out and lost his memory.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627087/"",""name"":""Kurt Neumann""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175645/"",""name"":""Eugene Conrad""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780412/"",""name"":""Edward E.

Rick had seen the potential for an airborne suicide attack on the twin towers as part of evaluating the risk posed to his wards within their building. After the attack in 1993 Rick took it personally to prepare and avoid the chaotic scenes that came with the 93 attack. This documentary tells the story of the man who predicted the 9/11 attacks and saved thousands of lives and died in the process.Although it was notable in the UK that the 4th anniversary of 9/11 came and went with comparatively little fuss, it did mean that this film got screened as one of several &quot;different&quot; documentaries about the attack. Before watching this film the only thing I knew about Rescorla was a small note in a paper shortly after the event that Hollywood was looking to make a film about a Cornish man who had saved lives during the attack. However I watched this documentary enthralled by the life of this professional man who had simply and heroically done his job and had saved thousands in the process. The film spends a little time looking back at his life but unsurprisingly the focus is 9/11. The second half surprised me because I thought I would be jaded by the footage of 9/11 by now, but I wasn&#39;t  it was still as impacting and as unbelievable as it was the very first time I saw it. Within this the film talks to the staff from Morgan Stanley who all talk about what happened and share their memories of Rescorla&#39;s actions. The story they tell of that day is enthralling and it is consistently engaging  it is a simple story of heroics and it is fascinating as such.The talking heads are all pretty good and are edited together well to paint the picture while the narration is level and helps the film avoid becoming sentimental. Overall this is a great documentary that tells one story of thousands of 9/11. It tells Rescorla&#39;s story in a level and balanced way that is free of sentiment and a very good testament to the simple, unassuming heroics of one man and much better than I imagine any dramatised version could do it.",,,"tt0482544"

What I saw was so little of either that even Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Michael Sheen couldn&#39;t salvage a comprehensive description of what this film is meant to be.Expectations were always going to be high with the talent involved - a film in this genre with Pegg and Frost of course makes you think you might be about to witness a new instalment in the Cornetto trilogy - but even the performances from all involved (including Neil&#39;s dad from The Inbetweeners and a few glimpses of Margot Robbie) couldn&#39;t forge an enjoyable film.There seems to be nothing that connects the story together. Plot threads go nowhere or end as abruptly as they were introduced. Sequences are edited to point of inducing nausea.I&#39;m really sorry, but I&#39;m so disappointed by this film. My expectations weren&#39;t high going in, but it successfully limboed underneath even my lowest of expectations.Best quote: &quot;I don&#39;t want to die unfulfilled.&quot; - &quot;I don&#39;t want to die a virgin.&quot; - &quot;I don&#39;t want to die wearing Greek sandals!&quot;",,,"tt6905696"

One of those favourites from a young age that holds up really well, and is even more entertaining through adult eyes from appreciating the writing and stories even more. Have been on a roll reviewing individual episodes for certain shows, animated, non-animated and of as many genres as possible (many as part of certain quests), and decided to do it with &#39;Talespin&#39; and some others. Something that, as expected and hoped, has proven to be a more than worthwhile project and experience. &quot;The Idol Rich&quot; is a very good episode if a favourite, just lacking the extra something and the villain while fun is not one of the most memorable or interesting (as unfair as it is to compare, give me Shere Khan and Don Karnage any day).The animation is very colourful and atmospheric as always. The music matches what is going on perfectly and it is impossible to forget or resist the theme song, one of the catchiest for anything Disney and ever. Writing is witty, very funny without being too silly and thought-probing without being complicated. Things don&#39;t get too childish and it is all easy to follow. The story is hugely compelling and lively in pace without being rushed, and executes a nice idea imaginatively.Baloo is a very fun and likeable character as always. Kit is neither too cute or too bratty, an appealing kid rather than an annoying one and his chemistry with Baloo has heart. Rebecca is charming and suitably shrewd and ambitious without it going overboard that it grates.Voice acting is terrific, Michael Gough enjoying himself. Ed Gilbert is a spirited Baloo. Sally Struthers brings spunk and charm.Overall, very enjoyable once again. 8/10 Bethany Cox","Baloo competes with Colonel Spigot to acquire a valuable idol, but uses brains over brawn to get the idol back when Spigot takes the idol from him.Baloo competes with Colonel Spigot to acquire a valuable idol, but uses brains over brawn to get the idol back when Spigot takes the idol from him.",,"tt0716802"

Ray Bolger appears for the third and final time as Grandpa Renfrew (now renamed Walter rather than Fred), while Rosemary De Camp would return as Grandma Amanda in &quot;Maid in San Pueblo,&quot; opposite Jackie Coogan in place of Bolger. For once, Shirley&#39;s parents aren&#39;t fighting, having spent a week with an encounter group, who want to share their new outlook with the rest of the family. By insisting on total honesty, they wind up putting the kids into an argumentative mood, which doesn&#39;t please mother Shirley one bit. Walter and Amanda finally decide to split up, and continue to live together in sin, trying to top one another in dating other people. While Walter entertains two young girls fascinated by The Great Depression (&quot;it&#39;s so depressing!&quot;), Amanda sits and listens to a businessman too busy boasting about his acumen to allow her to get a word in edgewise. Susan Dey tries out her Southern accent (later seen to hilarious advantage in &quot;Keith and Lauriebelle&quot;), while one of the young lovelies is played by Ondine Vaughn (later seen in &quot;Bedknobs and Drumsticks&quot;), one of the actresses previously featured on THE MONKEES (&quot;Card Carrying Red Shoes&quot;).

In hindsight it does sound like classic Brain in an interesting situation, superhero alter egos are always interesting. Then the plot synopsis was read and reading what Elmyra&#39;s role in the story was, hopes did diminish as her story did sound really infantile and very different from what is quite an intriguing and mature premise on Brain&#39;s side. Some of &#39;Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain&#39;s&#39; ideas did have promise, though none were that unique, but the show did vary on that front.&#39;Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain&#39; was a show that started very badly, and was a very mixed bag and never really above average level from then on (&quot;My Fair Brainy&quot; was the episode where the show did start to pick up and that didn&#39;t live up to full potential. It also ends very badly with &quot;The Mask of Braino&quot; and while Brain is nicely used any worries about how Elmyra would be written were not only exactly what it sounded like it was actually worse. Am not saying that with pleasure.&quot;Mask of Braino&quot; has a few good things. Brain is very entertaining and wonderfully deadpan, the show on the most part was a disaster when it came to character writing and interaction but somehow managed to get Brain spot on. It was a genius move having Maurice LaMarche back and he voices Brain perfectly. The voice acting has always been pretty good actually on reflection considering what the voice actors were given.Some of the animation is pretty decent, with some nice colour.However, that is pretty much it. While the animation was never terrible on &#39;Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain&#39;, it did always lack the polish and vibrancy as well as the imagination seen in the visuals of &#39;Animaniacs&#39;, &#39;Pinky and the Brain&#39; and &#39;Tiny Toon Adventures&#39;, which is generally the case here. There is nothing dynamic or infectious about the music and the theme song has always grated.Elmyra is absolutely intolerable here, one of her worst appearances and that is saying something. Considering that she made for one of the most annoying characters in animated history in &#39;Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain&#39; (she was take and leave in &#39;Tiny Toon Adventures&#39;. Any episode that has Elmyra in a big role is already dreaded, and everything that was annoying about her on this show (all negative characteristics taken to extremes and with no real redeeming merits to her). All the other characters are under-utilised and bland.The writing in &quot;Mask of Braino&quot; is overly simple and childish, nothing funny, sophisticated or witty about it. Elmyra&#39;s dialogue is an absolute embarrassment and much of me feels bad for Cree Summer for having to deliver it. The story is not just simplistic, completely unimaginative and predictable, it is also ridiculous, the vast difference between Brain and Elmyra&#39;s writing makes it feel like two episodes in one and the climactic moments are anti-climactic and tired. The chemistry between Brain and Elmyra is barely there and is disconnected whenever there is signs of any. Elmyra&#39;s alter ego is juvenile beyond belief, and that the show ends on one of its most childish moments is enough to make one cringe in the seat.Very weak ending all in all to a show that was slightly better on rewatch but never really got off the ground. 3/10.","Pinky and The Brain attempt to win public support by faking crimes and having The Brain, in the guise of crimefighting hero Braino, foil them.

While I would argue the story progresses a bit too fast for my liking, leaving entire characters delegated to a few seconds in a montage, that can&#39;t change the fact that this episode presents a great, simple story with a well executed payoff, building upon the foundations established for Jin&#39;s character in episode 1 while setting up a finale that will no doubt be both exciting and emotionally charged.8/10.

Love affairs, childhood friends, ex-boyfriend, one-sided love,.. everything is perfect for a shoujo lover like me.However, there are not many plot twists, as a 12-vol manga is a bit hard to be adapted to the big screen in less than 3 hours (or even 2). So many details have been cut, making this movie a bit nonsense and everything seems to be too easy to solve, the love affairs turn out to be what connects everything, instead of tangling. However, I love shoujo and the romantic spirits of this movie, I rate it 9.","Yuna and Akari are two high-school girls with different views on love: Yuna dreams about rose-colored romance, while Akari is down-to-earth and practical.

The movie is so haphazardly shot that, during her introductory scene, the main heroine is almost run over by a garbage truck while she&#39;s crossing the street. Apparently the director told her to keep walking and pretend it didn&#39;t happen because she tries, and it&#39;s hilarious. The rest of the movie is typical, soft-core fantasy-inspired exotic Emmanuelle stuff, with some bad dubbing. The &quot;beautiful, exotic star&quot; of the movie (the one who was almost squashed in her big debut scene) is about as endearing and seductive as the Filipino wife in PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","A married man with an unsatisfying sex life repeatedly dreams of making love to a mysterious Chinese woman somewhere in Hong Kong. Obsessed, the man and his wife head to Hong Kong where he encounters the woman from his dreams - who is, in reality, a prostitute. Now the man must convince the hooker they were meant to be together, but not before dealing with the hooker's jealous client, her mother, and his own wife's bewilderment. —Mike Justice <elchjunge@hotmail.com>A married man with an unsatisfying sex life repeatedly dreams of making love to a mysterious Chinese woman somewhere in Hong Kong.

A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I&#39;m only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. When you have only a donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards showing United States as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables, makes such an impression.NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see film. It balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, glances&#39; play, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character Lucy/Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures at Ellis Island). There&#39;s a mixed cast, going from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato, till a bitter and smashing Aurora Quattrocchi as the mother.

Then as (bad) luck would have it, in rapid succession I&#39;ve seen a couple of their mid - late 90&#39;s features: first The Silencers and now Hologram Man. Suffice to say PM specialised in producing a distinctive line of low-to-medium budget, low brow films mostly targeted for the home-video market.Hologram Man written by one of the co - leads Evan Lurie, is a fairly typical example of the PM fare, distinctive on this occasion, only in its arguably better than normal support cast and in its complete ripping off of the ideas behind the Sly Stallone/Wesley Snipes vehicle Demolition Man, which had come on to the market shortly beforehand. And let me be clear here, I&#39;m not suggesting for a moment that Demolition Man achieves lofty benchmarks in cinematic quality, because it doesn&#39;t. Clearly though PM through Hologram Man, is prepared to pay multiple and obvious homages to its better - known predecessor. But from my limited experience, I&#39;d be suggesting that this is what PM typically do. Take a random, multi - faceted grab-bag of ideas from other commercially successful movies, smash them violently and haphazardly together with endless shoot - outs and repetitive &quot;action scenes&quot;, combined with an inexpensive cast of limited acting talent and release to an unsuspecting public.I have to admit that the casting of Hologram Man may be of marginally better quality this time around, with well known names such as William Sanderson, John Amos, Michael Nouri and Alex Cord on the undercard. But ... oh dear! ... the lines they have to speak.Look I will admit, if you&#39;re a punter drawn to plentiful explosions and gunfire (PM staples), Hologram Man may keep you amused. I have to admit for me, this was a 100 minute film that felt twice as long. I won&#39;t bother trying to summarise the plot, the guts of which appeared to have been sketched out on a cigarette paper. Let&#39;s just say, there may be plenty of unintended laughter when observing the enormous body count and urban damage in films such as this. Realism is not one of this wannabe science - fiction flick&#39;s strong points. I think Hologram Man hopefully signifies the last of my personal involvements with PM entertainments.","Five years after the mad terrorist Norman Galagher was sentenced to holographic stasis, he is given a parole hearing.

But unlike most of their blockbuster counterparts, this movie is not about the movie that Alex and Elliot are writing, but it is about the friendship that they forge throughout the experiment.  Although the screenplay they are writing is not particulary good, the broader movie is able to focus on human nature, and the inexperienced actors are good in delivering timely humor.  On the whole, a strong movie and a good career start for up-and-coming director Christopher Livingston.  Well Done.","Alex Andero feels stuck washing dishes in his family's trattoria in New York City. He wants to write screenplays, and he has a great idea. Trouble is, he's not much with a typewriter; so, when his cousin calls and says a producer likes the idea and wants a script, Alex swallows his homophobia and asks for help from Elliot Springer, a talented writer who's an insecure, gay, Jewish nebbish. Elliot doesn't want the job, but Alex sets him up with Joey, a good-looking actor who works in the cafe. Elliot and Joey are soon getting it on, the script is slowly emerging, and Alex is discovering the beauty of Gwen, a woman in his writing class. Then, ego and greed threaten the partnership. —<jhailey@hotmail.com>","$1,200,000.00","tt0138493"

But thanks to YouTube, I watched it today, and it didn&#39;t take me long to figure out why no Canadian distributor apparently wanted to touch it. Even if you are a lover of westerns, you&#39;ll greatly dislike this movie, even more so if you don&#39;t care for the genre. It goes wrong in just about any way you can think of. While you&#39;ll (sort of) understand what the title figure is trying to do, the journey to that point is incredibly muddled. Maybe the original script made more sense, but under Michael Parks&#39; direction, things happen out of nowhere, and other things make no sense at all, and this constantly happens from the start to the end. The action sequences and even the scenes of dialogue seem to have been edited with a very limited amount of available footage, and have no zip as well as coherence. The movie plods on scene after scene with almost no energy. Also, the movie has a really cheap feeling, seemingly filmed on whatever abandoned buildings and countryside the production could get its hands on. And while the movie was made in the mid 1980s, it has a weird look and feel of a production from the mid 1970s. Don&#39;t expect this movie to get a release on DVD or Blu-Ray any time soon.","Gunfighter Josey Wales travels to Mexico to get a friend out of jail.",,"tt0331327"

Classics such as &quot;Idhayam oru koil&quot;, &quot;Yaar veettil roja&quot;, &quot;Koottathile koil pura&quot;, and &quot;Naan paadum mouna raagam&quot; are still a hit among Tamil listeners. My personal favourite is &quot;Vaanuyarntha soliayile&quot;, written by Paavalar Varadarajan, Ilayaraja&#39;s brother and mentor. The storyline is nothing great - Mohan comes to the city, makes it big as a singer, Radha has the hots for him but he has eyes only for booze, and thereby hangs a tale. Mohan is surprisingly tolerable here. It&#39;s hard to believe this is a Mani Ratnam film, as it has practically none of the irritating features of his later films (like clichéd stilted dialogue, overdose of semi-darkness, insufferable heroines, bad comedy tracks).

That version ran less than an hour and had narration from Paul Killiam himself. It was probably taken from his old SILENTS PLEASE TV series (which would account for the narration) and gives you a feel for the film, but now Flicker Alley has given us an 81 minute version that not only plays well but gives us the opportunity to appreciate the glorious at sea cinematography as well as the more complete performances from the actors.Long before he became associated with the role of Hopalong Cassidy, William Boyd was a capable leading man for Cecil B. De Mille during the late 1920s. In CLIPPER he is joined by his wife Elinor Fair, child actor Junior Coghlan, and veteran silent villain Walter Long. The real stars here are the clipper ships which were refitted for the movie and captured on film for all time. The movie is also one of only 3 films from director Rupert Julian to survive. Julian&#39;s main claim to fame is the 1925 Lon Chaney PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. He was also given solo credit for the 1923 MERRY-GO-ROUND where he took over from a fired Erich von Stroheim.The title of this DVD, UNDER FULL SAIL, refers to the 3 documentaries included as well as THE YANKEE CLIPPER. They are SHIP AHOY, THE SQUARE RIGGER, and AROUND THE HORN IN A SQUARE RIGGER. Bonus features in addition to the docs are a 10 minute excerpt from the 1922 feature DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS (which is fully available elsewhere) and an audio interview with 90 year old Frank (Junior) Coghlan who was 10 when he made CLIPPER. Special mention should also be made of the fine organ scores provided by Dennis James who has stepped in to fill the shoes of the late Gaylord Carter. Yet another top flight release from Flicker Alley. Thanks to all concerned who helped bring this project to fruition...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic.",,,"tt0018601"

His Guardian is much in the spirt of when Jack Kirby took over the Superman&#39;s Pal series, albeit updated.Yet, from a couple of posted reviews, this is what we gleam from racist fanboys: Let&#39;s play ostrich with our heads in the sand and pretend racism has never existed and is completely a thing of the past. It can&#39;t even be breathed. If it is, then it&#39;s slapped with the old yawn-inducing pretentious standby label of &quot;liberal propaganda.&quot; Despite the fact that social issues have been part of comics since the 1940s. Too, said reviewers are too obtuse to grasp that their spews go the distance in proving racism is alive and well, especially among fanboys. The commentary, by Olsen, is brief, subtle and referring to a childhood trauma, but oh my God, he mentioned it and so the fanboys have their superhero jockey shorts in a wad. In plot and themes, Supergirl is growing up (unlike some of the crybaby fans who want Leave it to Beaver girl) and the third season easily surpasses the previous two. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s CW&#39;s second highest series (only behind Flash).Reign is proving to be one of Supergirl&#39;s better antagonists (Livewire was probably her best). Supergirl is different from Superman in that she has a colorful rogue&#39;s gallery (Superman, unlike Flash, Batman, and Spiderman, never really had a strong stable of villains). Hopefully, writer&#39;s won&#39;t do another &quot;bad guys sees the light and converts&quot; finale for Reign. The continuing saga of MM&#39;s father is also compelling and touching.",,,"tt7762822"

The sisters talk the Reverend Mother into letting them trade in the jalopy and buy another used car with the $800 they have on hand. Sister Bertrille turns to Money Back Hernando, the most notorious used car dealer in San Juan. They strike a deal for a station wagon for $800, plus the trade-in. The new car ends up being a lemon. But luckily, it breaks down next to where Carlos is picnicking with his latest conquest, Diane. He manages to fix it to the best of his ability, but he suggests the sister take the car back to Hernando and get her money back. Money Back is not true to his name, and they negotiate $500 for the buy-back, but she has to come back later for the money. Vehicleless, Sister Bertrille talks Carlos into letting her use his station wagon to drive the children to the carnival. So Sister Bertrille drops Carlos' station wagon off at the convent, and tells the kids to tell the other sisters that she'll be back shortly and will explain the situation, while she heads back into town to pick up the $500. The sisters see the beautiful station wagon and assume it's the one Sister Bertrille bought with the $800. However just as the kids go off, the water heater in the convent falls apart, and they're going to need the $800 back. So Sister Jacqueline takes Carlos' car back to Money Back and sells it to him for $800. Money Back, never one to pass up a good deal however shady, agrees despite not knowing anything about Sister Jacqueline's story but indeed knowing that the car is well worth more than $800. He turns around and lists it for $1,500. So Sister Bertrille needs to go to Carlos to ask for a loan of $1,000, which added to her $500 will allow her to buy his car back. She is reluctant to tell him what she needs the money for, and he explodes when he finds out the reason. However, he comes up with a plan. Sister Bertrille is to go back and buy the old jalopy from Money Back, which she does for $15. Then Carlos goes to Money Back asking to buy the jalopy, implying that a wealthy investor is in town looking for old vehicles such as that and paying a fortune for such. So Carlos and Money Back go to the convent to bid on the jalopy. Money Back eventually buys it back for $3,000, at which time Carlos infers that the investor, while real, is not in town nor might he ever be.

Also many scenes with the same Robert Cunningham, in fact the same scene always, in which he tries to remember where the suitcase with money is and fails. Anyway, Stafford is a very good actor and is believable and convincing in all scenes. Nathalie Delon and Marcel Bozzuffi are just as good, credible and convincing. And Alberto de Mendoza is good in the role of Ashley. The only one who is not credible is Enrico Maria Salerno, an excellent actor in many other films, in which he always played positive heroes. Here, with his face of a good man, he does not convince in the final scene that in fact he was the scoundrel all along who stole the money stolen by the bandits. The first scene in the film, the attack on the van with money, is clearly superior to the rest of the film, it is extremely dynamic, it almost seems real, true, and Bozzuffi demonstrates how expert he was in such roles.","Robert is a police agent of American origins who lost his memory through an accident during a robbery in a branch of the Bank of America.

Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably.BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the template for this film. It is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it IMDb**********Ten. The story is simple, Love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Why, it just happened for the two (2) principals involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are conventionally leading Star material, but quality Character Actors. For the details watch the film.Now what went wrong? A T.V. Movie, remade practically scene for scene with name actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb******Six. Both actors though appear disinterested, just showing up to punch their time-clocks and pick up their checks. Neither are involved with their characters or with each other. You do not believe they are in Love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them. That should not be and that&#39;s why it fails in its intent. Sometimes it is just better to leave things alone.","On one of their usual weekly commutes into the city, two perfect strangers--Dr Alec Harvey, an esteemed suburban doctor, and Anna Jesson, a middle-class housewife--will inadvertently find love, when a bit of dirt enters Anna's eye and the good doctor comes to her rescue.

What caught my attention here was the title. Then I started to investigate the press release to learn that this is getting in 2024 after doing festivals. Being that this is from Italy was a perk as well. Other than that, I went into seeing this blind.Synopsis: Agnese (Susanna Costaglione) is a wolf biologist who gets back to her family after a long hospitalization in a mental institution. Her daughter, Arianna (Sofia Ponente) is an introverted teenager who lives for dancing and has a problematic relationship with her mother. The father, Riccardo (Edoardo Oliva), is a doctor who tries to hold the pieces of a family about to collapse.We start this with Agnese getting out of the hospital. Riccardo is inquiring about how she is doing and anything that he should know. The goal here is to go out to an isolated cabin to allow her to rest. There is more to it that we learn about later. This is taking place right as the pandemic is ramping up. I&#39;m also guessing that this is part of why she is being released and they&#39;re getting out of the city.Coming with them is Arianna. We first see her as she practices a dance. She is quite good at what she does. This family arrives at the location. Things take a turn when Riccardo tells Agnese that he has to go back to the city. He has work and must see a patient. This creates a bigger issue though, when he cannot return. He has an exposure that puts him into intensive care as he needs to be intubated. Agnese then starts to regress. The isolation and wondering what her husband is doing plays into that.We then see that she suffers from sleepwalking. She goes outside and sees something that is referred to as The God (Elena Battarin). This is an eerie entity with glowing eyes. There is also a tragedy that led to Agnese first breakdown. There was a son, Leonardo. Tragedy struck there and he died as a baby. Agnese has blamed herself and she believes that Riccardo does as well. Arianna asks about what happened there, and then as things go on, we see what happened that fateful morning.That is where I&#39;ll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that this doesn&#39;t have the deepest story, but it does what it needs to set up the setting and then show us as our characters descend into madness. What is intriguing here is that this is a character study of Agnese and Arianna. I didn&#39;t realize in the beginning that these two have a contentious relationship. Both do well in hiding it. The daughter because her mother just got released from the hospital and doesn&#39;t want her to relapse from upsetting her. That wears away as they&#39;re quarantined together without Riccardo. Agnese also loves her daughter, but she knows that Arianna favors Riccardo. This married couple has their own issues that get thrown in the face of Arianna when she sides with her father. This gets quite tense.Let me then delve deeper into these two characters and the situation. First there is Agnese. Her being this wolf expert is incidental. It explains why they go to this remote location and we see her returning to the work she started. The only thing I&#39;ll include here is that she believes there is a lone wolf in the area so that intrigues her. It also could explain why she sees this entity in the woods. It doesn&#39;t look like the Christian God, but more of a beastly thing. I&#39;ll also include here that she believes Riccardo is having an affair. He did in the past, but when he doesn&#39;t return this time, she is convinced it is still ongoing. I hate that he is cheating on her. The more we learn here though, the more I understand. I&#39;m still not condoning it though.Then there is Arianna. I didn&#39;t realize until writing this that she was an introvert. It is hard to show this when you have such a small cast and showing us a story that is set during the pandemic where none of us were seeing people. What is interesting here is that we get just enough of her until things ramp up. Then we see that she catches her father talking to another woman on the phone and ignores it when she was younger. She also has an awkward talk with her father when she has her first period. I&#39;m assuming that this fell on his shoulders due to Agnese being committed. It is also told through flashbacks. Now we see her and her mother butt heads as the story progresses, these two aren&#39;t as different as they think though. Arianna also harbors a dark secret.I want to then end this out by going over the situation. This is a perfect use of a pandemic story. Seeing that this hit festivals in 2022, I&#39;m guessing it was made during. It is fitting to come out of Italy since they were hit so hard early on. The fear is there. We also got to see what happened when they were stuck in the house with one or two other people. They get sick of each other and then their issues bubble up to being worse. I did like how this isn&#39;t the focus. It is crucial to set it up. This worked for me.Next up should then be the acting. I thought that Costaglione and Ponente carried this. It is great that at first, we&#39;re seeing them tiptoe around each other. You get that idea that there&#39;s been time apart so they don&#39;t necessarily know how to act. What I love is that at the climax, these two aren&#39;t as different as they think. Both do a great job and I was engaged to see where this would end. Oliva was good to set the stage. Through flashbacks we also fill in what was needed there. Battarin had such a creepy look. Credit there to the make-up, costume and how it was shot as well. Other than that, the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.All that is left then is filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography and framing were good. How they showed us the setting to capture that isolated feel was great. They also don&#39;t throw in your face that this is during the pandemic. I appreciated that. I also love the sequences in the woods. Those are creepy especially with this strange entity. This is limited to the effects needed and used aside from that. The soundtrack and design were also fine for what was needed. Something there is hearing Riccardo talking on the phone and then lying to Arianna. That changes my thoughts on him for sure.In conclusion, this is a solid film that I&#39;m glad that I got the chance to check out. This is a slow burn that takes time to develop. What we get here is an interesting character study of this mother and daughter. They are more alike than they realize. Their performances carry this. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed. This was well-made. Capturing the isolated feeling is great. The cinematography, framing and look of this entity in the woods were great. I&#39;ll say here that this is a deliberating paced work. I think it will bore people, but if you like slow burns, give this a watch. Not traditional horror either. I still consider it.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","A deep, slow descent into madness. Agnese is a wolf biologist who gets back to her family after a long hospitalization in a mental institution. Her daughter Arianna is an introverted teenager who lives for dancing and has a problematic relationship with her mother. Her husband, Riccardo, is a doctor who tries to hold the pieces of a family about to collapse. The moon has an occult power over Agnese, whose mind begins to disrupt and her body transforms, while the visions of the ""God of the woods"" intrude on reality. As Riccardo gets seriously ill due to the pandemic, mother and daughter will find themselves alone to deal with the ghosts from the past, locked in a house surrounded by woods, where nightmares take over, and obscure presences become evermore disturbing.

The story revolves around the life of a newly married couple Roy and Tina who are settled in Singapore. Roy is a renowned Indian scientist doing his research on a project called GRAHANAM - The Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse And Its Impact On Human Psychology. Tina is a homemaker and an avid book reader. Roy's and Tina's happy married life lands into unsettling loop of twists when a doubt about Roy's identity haunts Tina. Roy on the other hand is shaken by Tina's unexpected hostile behavior. This creates conflicts and drift between the couple and Roy consults his dear ones for advice when the situation starts to go out of his control. None of the close circle of friends notice any sort of changes in Tina's behavior, instead they sense Roy's overwhelming work pressure could be the cause of uncertainties in their life. Finally, on the night of GRAHANAM, a life threatening incident that happens between the couple leaves everyone in shock. What happens that night? Who is the culprit? Did Roy become the victim of his own research about psychological effects of Lunar eclipse? Or is there a different dimension intertwined to the current situation to bury a dark secret? WHAT IS THE TRUTH. The film attempts to join all the untied and unsolved nodes with a gripping screenplay, vibrant visuals, feel good songs, light humour, suspense elements and intense emotions.

Hard rock, heavy metal and melodic rock are almost always at their best live, and this is one of the very best from the tail end of rock music&#39;s golden age.Van Halen kick off this concert with &quot;There&#39;s Only One Way To Rock&quot;, which was written by lead vocalist Sammy Hagar before he replaced David Lee Roth. Hagar is no mean axeman himself, and the twin lead here is the perfect way to open any show.These guys are what rock musicians were meant to be: talented, extrovert, and at times outrageous. As showmanship goes, they want for nothing. In addition to Mr Van Halen&#39;s guitar virtuosity we see a splendiferous bass solo from Michael Anthony, and more than a little audience participation.Nothing deep from these all-American kids, no &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; or &quot;Xanadu&quot;, just good rockin&#39;.

The Barbary Coast is in turmoil, with saloon owner Dude Forante (Turhan Bey), and Rio Jordan (Alan Curtis), who runs a mission as a front for illegal activities, vying for the top spot. Forante wants the two to work together, but Jordan refuses. Sally gets a job singing at Forante's saloon and quickly becomes the star attraction. Sally receives a ring that belonged to her brother and takes it to police headquarters and convinces Police Captain Dan Martin (Thomas Gomez) to investigate. She and Martin go to Jordan for help. He claims that Fontaine, who Sally has fallen in love with, murdered Sally's brother and fabricates some incriminating evidence. Broken-hearted Sally plans to return to Cambridge, but showgirl Mickey (Collette Lyons) persuades her to stay. Sally confronts Forante, but he refuses to comment. At the mission, Sally finds evidence that Jordan may actually be her brother. Learning that Sally has returned to Forante, Jordan arms himself and goes to the saloon to confront Forante. —Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>",,"tt0037717"

It has the distinction of having three actors all of whom had long careers in the cinema, Arthur Kennedy, Anthony Quinn, and Cornel Wilde.Kennedy is the star here, a rather arrogant young prizefrighter full of himself and thinking no one can lick him. He&#39;s going to get out of the fight racket before he becomes a punch drunk stumblebum. But he&#39;s got a young wife to support in Olympe Bradna so he reluctantly continues his career under a new manager Anthony Quinn. Wilde plays the decent young man who would like to get things going with Bradna, but she can only see Kennedy.I think this film was once again something intended for James Cagney, but even Cagney with his street charm would have been hard pressed to make the character that Kennedy plays likable and sympathetic. Quinn as manager does do Kennedy dirt, but you almost can&#39;t blame him for what happens.Kennedy and Quinn do manage to rise above their material and you can see why they became stars. Wilde just isn&#39;t given anything to work with and you can see Warner Brothers dropped him when he went off to World War II. No hint of the magnetism he showed later on when he became a lead.There are a couple of other nice parts, Virginia Field as a smart mouth gossip columnist who starts her own gossip with Kennedy and Cliff Edwards as Kennedy&#39;s corner man.Knockout had some potential, but it essentially remains a knockoff product from Warner Brothers assembly line.","Fighter Johnny Rocket (Arthur Kennedy) agrees to the request of his fiancée, Angela, (Olympe Bradna) to quit boxing after his next bout. Promoter Trego (Anthony Quinn), who has just purchased Johnny's contract, urges him to continue and realize his abilities, but Johnny refuses. Later, after the couple marries and Angela is pregnant, Johnny can't find work and returns to Trego and the ring.

However, the scene with me was over pretty quickly and I eagerly watched the rest of the movie, to see if the critics were correct. I am happy to say, they weren&#39;t. The characters were likable, and were played really well. Of course, having Colm Feore in a movie is always a bonus, but the rest of the cast did a terrific job. As for the plot... Without giving any spoilers, I will say this, I expected this movie to be decent, but I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was clever, elaborate and full of twists. And the film&#39;s artistic style was unique without being pretentious. I had a blast watching this movie, and sincerely wish they&#39;d release it on DVD.

Not as bad as some and the acting could have used a little more rehearsal but the actions scenes were pretty good. Really enjoyed the costume of the main bad guy (girl) Nikki.

Thankfully I found a cheap copy online. Cool cover artwork &amp; the picture is letterboxed, but sadly these are the only two positive things that I can say about this dross. Bad acting, a very confusing plot which soon outstays it&#39;s welcome, the film is mainly boring dialogue between just a few characters, most of which takes place in a single green room. Poor production values (shadows of crew &amp; equipment are visible). One character, played by Nancy Lincors, talks about having a baby, but she looks at least 50. To sit through the film&#39;s 95 minutes running time is a true test of endurance &amp; not one that I could recommend.

"I Against I",,"[""Drama"",""Romance""]","Emma, with help from Manny, tries to cheer up Spike on her separation from Snake, especially as it is Spike and Snake's third wedding anniversary. They call in Caitlin from Los Angeles for some female bonding. Just after Caitlin arrives, Snake returns home, just to give Spike an anniversary gift he had purchased months earlier. After Snake leaves, Spike opens the package to find a sapphire necklace - her birthstone - and although she looks touched by the gift, throws it into the garbage. They also plan a female only anniversary party, complete with stripper waiters. The festivities come to a complete halt when one of the strippers physically resembles Snake; after the party, she admits to herself and to Caitlin that she still loves Snake. Meanwhile Spinner remains in limbo between his old friends and his new Friendship Club support network. At a school fair where Spinner sits as the target in the Friendship Club's dunk tank, a still angry Jimmy continually dunks Spinner, and would continue to do so if given the chance. However Marco and Spinner tentatively reconnect. This reconnection is put to the test as Linus, the most extreme of the Friendship Club members, asks Spinner to intercede with Marco in his plans to hold a safer sex seminar as Linus believes that such a seminar promotes sexual activity rather than abstinence which is the only form of safe sex Linus supports. After Miss Hatzilakos reconfirms her support for the seminar, Linus and Spinner decide to hold a protest at the seminar, at which a confrontation complete with derogatory remarks and fisticuffs ensues specifically between Linus and Marco. This confrontation brings Spinner's true allegiances into a clearer light.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768737"",""name"":""Stefan Scaini""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0776946"",""name"":""Linda Schuyler""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0602037"",""name"":""Yan Moore""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393496"",""name"":""Kit Hood""}],""title"":""Writers""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1257092"",""name"":""Stacey Farber""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1011682"",""name"":""Miriam McDonald""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1280174"",""name"":""Mike Lobel""}],""title"":""Stars""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0557359/mediaviewer/rm481216256"",""name"":""Adamo Ruggiero in Degrassi: The Next Generation (2001)""}]","[{""actor"":""Stacey Farber"",""character"":""Ellie Nash"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1257092""},{""actor"":""Miriam McDonald"",""character"":""Emma Nelson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1011682""},{""actor"":""Mike Lobel"",""character"":""Jay Hogart"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1280174""},{""actor"":""Deanna Casaluce"",""character"":""Alex Nuñez"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1714757""},{""actor"":""Andrea Lewis"",""character"":""Hazel Aden"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506916""},{""actor"":""Cassie Steele"",""character"":""Manny Santos"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1012247""},{""actor"":""Lauren Collins"",""character"":""Paige Michalchuk"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172472""},{""actor"":""Ryan Cooley"",""character"":""J.T.

However, once in a while there are rap/hip hop figures that are talented and have music that is more than tolerable for rap.One such example is Christopher &quot;Notorious B.I.G&quot; Wallace, whose life was documented in the 2009 film &#39;Notorious&#39;, which did have issues but there were things such as the brilliant performance of Jamal Woolward that made it watchable. Another example is Tupac, whose life is documented here in 2017&#39;s &#39;All Eyez on Me&#39;. &#39;All Eyez On Me&#39; could have been good, for somebody who did have an interesting life. Unfortunately it really does fail to do this artist and his life justice.&#39;All Eyez on Me&#39; isn&#39;t without redeeming values. Its best asset, and the only outstanding thing about it, is the lead performance of Demetrius Shipp Jr, who perfected Tupac&#39;s look and mannerisms to startling effect. The cast were largely miss, but there were a couple of hits in the form of Jamal Woolward, again as Notorious B.I.G, and particularly Kat Graham who really tries to give some heart to the film and to her scenes with Shipp Jnr.However, &#39;All Eyez On Me&#39; goes on for far too long (have sat through many long films and there are a lot that are brilliant, such as &#39;Lawrence of Arabia&#39;, &#39;Ben Hur&#39; and &#39;Gone With the Wind) and such a length isn&#39;t justified by how little it does with its content. It does try to cram in too much, some of it in a short space of time, and doesn&#39;t explore any of it in enough detail. Some scenes were random and unnecessary, succeeding in slowing the film down and making one question why they were there in the first place.With the information given in &#39;All Eyez On Me&#39;, it all felt like a series of bullet points, explored in cliff-notes form at best and at worst telling us nothing. Didn&#39;t care for the idea to spell out Tupac&#39;s every thought when it once again tells us little, as one can see &#39;All Eyez On Me&#39; is very short on revelations or anything new (which is misleading as it was advertised in a way that it would tell us something new and un-told) which is frustrating and feels like a cheat for fans. Some of it, especially the scenes detailing Tupac&#39;s relationship with Jada, felt like the truth had been distorted for dramatic effect/license.Didn&#39;t see the need for the narration either in filmed interview form, that was very clumsily inserted and basically spoon-fed events with no subtlety whatsoever. Amateur hour Youtube and music videos have better production values than here, and while the music was good a lot of the placing was random. It&#39;s all poorly scripted, flatly directed and whose bright idea was it to bring in performers and such as themselves and not give them anything to do.In conclusion, Tupac deserved better, in no way does &#39;All Eyez On Me&#39;, despite Shipp Jnr and Graham&#39;s valiant efforts, do the man and his very interesting (which couldn&#39;t have been less compellingly depicted here) life justice. 2/10 Bethany Cox",,"$40,000,000.00","tt1666185"

Where this show differs from other sitcoms like Seinfeld or Family Guy 
for example, is it isn&#39;t afraid to squeeze in some really emotional moments as well. The Office (US) occasionally did this, but Parks and Rec takes pride in their sentimentality. That isn&#39;t to say that there is too much, but whenever there is some, it&#39;s always very effective. Season 4 is the season that truly
starts this. Now that the characters are fully developed, we are attached to all of them, so it makes the more sweeter moments involving these characters even better. Season 4&#39;s opener, &quot;I&#39;m Leslie Knope&quot; is a great example of how funny while also endearing the show can be. The episode leaves off right where Season 3 ended. Leslie has just gotten a major career opportunity to run for higher office. She is still unsure on whether she should run for office or continue dating Ben and not risk a public scandal. This is the main question that the whole episode is based around. Meanwhile, Ron&#39;s other ex-wife, &quot;Tammy One&quot; is in the premises and Ron decides the best option is to get out ASAP. I love how prepared Ron was for this exact situation, and also how fast he can grow a beard, as we see later on in the episode. I think its a smart decision to end the episode right where Season 3 left off, just because there was so many cliffhangers. I don&#39;t think they could have done it any other way.The subplots are great as well. Back at City Hall, an inappropriate email is sent to all the female workers of a man&#39;s genitals. Ann, who now works at City Hall as the Public Relations Director for the Health Department, notices that the man who sent the photo actually has mumps. When Ann announces the ironic
situation, this eventually leads to everyone at City Hall showing Ann pictures of their junk to see if they have mumps as well. It&#39;s very funny seeing how pervy all the men are in the department and watching Ann&#39;s reactions to all this. Also we find out yet another incredible trait about Jerry&#39;s character at the end of the episode, proving once again why he might be the most impressive man in Pawnee.This show&#39;s cast is very big, but impressively they are able to juggle everyone&#39;s storylines so effortlessly. And the cast is so good, that there&#39;s never a dull moment. I also forgot to mention Tom&#39;s new business venture, Entertainment 720 has officially launched, and Tom is excited about showing off his new stuff. It&#39;s a funny storyline just because of how ridiculous the whole idea is, and how nobody really understands what it is exactly. Everything in this episode really works and it does a great job of setting up the main storyline that will run until the season finale. Quick side note: All my favorite moments in this episode involve Ben and Leslie and it is their relationship that will become the main focal point for the entire season. Ben will become the 2nd major character behind Leslie for the remainder of the series, so if you like his character, you are in luck.","Leslie has to break up with Ben to follow her dream of running for office.

Ricky (as Ricky Nelson) is the most excited Nelson; wearing his skeleton costume early, he allows Ozzie to apply some ghostly white make-up. As the family sifts through their costumes, David (as David Nelson) wears a long, funny nose. After consulting with Thorny (Don DeFore), Ozzie decides the adults&#39; Halloween doldrums are the result of poor party planning. But, when the men take over, Halloween goes awry...Ozzie and the family put their stamp of approval on Halloween celebrations, for both kids and adults. It&#39;s nice to see the grown-ups having fun, but Dave and Ricky&#39;s off-screen party might have been more interesting. Going for the heart of those disapproving of Halloween, Ozzie wears a Devil costume. Ricky&#39;s cute skeleton outfit steals the show (it sure is &quot;a neat outfit&quot;). The episode takes advantage of Rick&#39;s fondness for dressing up (and breaking out in song and dance).

Captors Germans abduct an American Major with knowledge of top-secret invasion and he is drugged and tortured by Nazis. The Nazis think he has information on plans for another invasion . He wakes up in an Army hospital with amnesia , as Pike can&#39;t remember anything about this . When they can&#39;t get the information through torture they attempt something totally different . Pike is also being treated by Dr. Gerber (Rod Taylor) and Diana (Eva Marie Saint) to recover from his memory loss. But Pike begins to think that Dr. Gerber has a different intention for him . They try to convince him that World War II is over , so that they can get details about the Allied invasion of Europe out of him. Then , he&#39;s coerced into telling the Nazi Doctor Gerber and his Gestapo overlord (Werner Peters) , all the plans concerning the D-Day landings by allied forces in France. Are they telling the truth or is this an elaborate hoax ?A nail-biting and enjoyable movie with workmanlike direction and solid interpretations , containing an attractive premise : a high-ranking WWII Army Officer is captured by the Nazis , Pike is then woken up , told the war is over and they want the date of Normandy . But Maj. Jefferson Pike, in a position to lose the entire war for the Allied forces in Europe and he&#39;s not sure what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t , especially when the doc asks him to explain , in great detail , what happened just before he lost his memory . The main and support cast do reasonable jobs . James Garner is frankly well as Pike , as he is kidnapped, drugged and taken to a supposedly American hospital in what is supposed to be post war Germany . Eva Marie Saint is brilliant as the nurse who cares and deceives him . While Rod Taylor , unusually cast , is the best as an American-speaking dedicated German shrink telling him that war&#39;s been over some time . Along with an adequate secondary cast , such as : Werner Peters giving memorable acting as a nasty SS officer , John Banner , Russell Thorson , Sig Ruman and veteran Alan Napier . It had an acceptable but inferior remake with similar plot as interesting in their own right as the original , though really no match for the previous line up of , titled ¨Breaking Point¨(original title1989) by Peter Markle with Corbin Bernsen , Joanna Pacula , John Glover , David Marshall Grant , Lawrence Pressman.This motion picture 36 Hours was stunningly directed by George Seaton. Professional and polish writer and director who occasionally rose well above his average standard and was twice rewarded with Academy Award for so making . Seaton formed a partnership with William Perlberg , was to produce all Seaton&#39;s movies for several years . Both of them produced and directed the following successes as ¨Miracle on 34th Street¨, ¨The country girl¨, a monster Box office as ¨Airport¨ , the warlike movie : ¨Counterfeit traitor¨ and , of course , another unusual War film as ¨36 hours¨ . Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average .","In this psychological war-drama an Army Major is captured by the Germans during World War II.

Sorry if this sounds confusing.Due to that there are some decent or watchable &quot;Beary Family&quot; cartoons, especially &#39;Fowled-Up Birthday&#39; and &#39;Mother&#39;s Little Helper&#39; (both directed by Jack Hannah, who generally is a much stronger animation director than Paul J. Smith and his cartoons much better). However, there are also a fair share of horrible ones, beforehand especially seen with &#39;Charlie&#39;s Mother-in-Law&#39;. This may be an unpopular view, as indicated by that it is rated very low here (which could be that people do dislike it and it could also be down to not having a lot of user rating votes), but to me &#39;Guest Who&#39; was one of the better &quot;Beary Family&quot; cartoons.&#39;Guest Who&#39;, like the rest of the better-faring entries in the series, is not great by any stretch. Like many 60s Lantz-studio cartoons, the animation is not good. Time and budget constraints shows in a lot of the animation, which is very rushed looking in the drawing and detail wise it&#39;s on the simplistic and careless side with colours that lack vibrancy and a fair share of goofs. The story is pretty slight and contains few surprises and could have benefited from feeling a little less noisy and at times tighter timing.Bessie&#39;s role here is very limited and pretty repetitive, what she is given to do and who she treats Charlie again makes her a character difficult to like. The ending is senseless and even for a &quot;Beary Family&quot; cartoon pretty mean-spirited.However, the music puts one in a good mood and is rousing and lush. Am liking the main &quot;Beary Family&quot; theme more with each cartoon of theirs. Found myself liking Junior here again like in the previous cartoon (not always the case), he&#39;s a half-wit but this is one of the strongest examples of him also meaning well. The monkey is absolutely adorable, also an amusing and clever monkey, and very nearly steals the show from under Charlie despite the predictable in outcome antics.For a Smith-directed &quot;Beary Family&quot; cartoon, while never hilarious or innovative the gags are actually amusing and have much crisper timing generally to usual (though parts are still clumsy and could have been tighter, but not as badly as other entries in the series), regardless of whether the outcomes are foreseeable. Charlie&#39;s dialogue amuses.Despite Junior making one of his cooler and more likable appearances, the best, most interesting and funniest character is Charlie. It is very easy to relate to and like him, and Paul Frees&#39; deft voice work helps a lot. The voice work generally is good, with Daws Butler proving to be a better fit for Junior than Frees. Grace Stafford has little to do though.All in all, to me one of the better &quot;Beary Family&quot; cartoons although it is a long way from being great let alone a classic. 6/10 Bethany Cox","Junior is a participant in a nightclub dancing contest and is declared the winner.

On the plus side, the pretty hill-top village of Castelfalfi serves as the location and the two female leads, Malù as Lady Chatterley and Debora Calì as the model are quite something to behold, but the rest of the film is rather flat.As in the original, Lady Chatterley is frustrated at her husband&#39;s inability to perform his husbandly bedroom duties and so she seeks solace in the arms - and bed - of the lustily handsome hired estate hand. There is also the added complication of the stunningly beautiful artist&#39;s model who is posing for Lady Chatterley&#39;s artwork. Both the model and the hired hand lust after each other, and as the old saying goes, three into two won&#39;t go.Despite both leading ladies willing to shed their clothes, the sex scenes are rather underwhelming which is ultimately the fault of the director. Finally, there is a problem with the running time which says 104 minutes on both the IMDb page and the DVD cover but which actually comes in at a measly 78 minutes for the Italian DVD - so something is seriously amiss.

Not all childhood favourites have held up, but &#39;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&#39; is one of the strongest examples of those that have.While the original three 60s-70s short films (&#39;Honey Tree&#39;, &#39;Blustery Day&#39; and &#39;Tigger Too&#39;) and the 1977 &#39;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&#39; are just a little better, &#39;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&#39; is one of the Winnie the Pooh franchise&#39;s high points. &quot;Nothing But the Tooth&quot; is a great episode, but if there was a top 15-20 of the show&#39;s best episodes &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is definitely up there in my estimations.The animation is very bright, well drawn and colourful, everything looking lush, detailed and smooth, sometimes with a darker style. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is particularly beautifully animated, with a beautifully moody opening and a very elegantly rendered sunset at the tear-jerking end. The music is playfully jaunty and beautifully orchestrated, enhancing scarier moments with hauntingly urgent and eerie scoring, sadder moments with poignant and particularly lush and emotional scoring and the more playful moments with a jaunty touch. The theme tune is very rousing and one of the catchiest theme songs of any animated show of the late 80s.Writing has a perfect mix of whimsy, drollness, wit, charm and childhood innocence. The childhood innocence and drollness is particularly striking in &quot;Nothing But the Tooth&quot;, while &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is more emotionally impacting and moody, one of the show&#39;s moodiest and most touching. Love Pooh&#39;s lovable drollness in &quot;Nothing But the Tooth&quot;, while &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has some cracking humorous lines contrasting beautifully with the moody and emotional tone, especially &quot;What a blustery morning. It must be winds day again&quot; and Tigger&#39;s &quot;Where? Where? I don&#39;t see any flying Piglet, probably just one of those unidentified omelets&quot;.Both stories are simple but lovingly and charmingly told, with &quot;Nothing But the Tooth&quot; funnier and more whimsical (one can also relate to Pooh, as all of us have been there in losing our teeth), while &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is layered and more emotional. The part where Pooh, Gopher, Tigger and Rabbit get flushed down the drain being one of the funniest parts of the entire show.All the characters carry both episodes wonderfully, Tigger is hilarious, Pooh is very lovable and Piglet is affectingly adorable, but one cannot write about these episodes without talking about the scene-stealing pack rats, they are hilarious but also very cute at the same time. The vocal cast are uniformly excellent.In conclusion, one great episode and one top-tier episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox","After being blown around in the wind, Piglet is afraid to go outside again. When Pooh falls out of bed, he finds a tooth on the floor, and Rabbit tells him that it's his sweet tooth, and he must get it back to eat honey again.After being blown around in the wind, Piglet is afraid to go outside again.

Fuzzy comes to the ranch, after he learns that his cousin Luke purchased it, but when he arrives, he&#39;s told by Gowdey&#39;s men that they never heard of a Luke Jones. Meanwhile, another prospective buyer, Marshall, is ambushed by Gowdey&#39;s men, but is saved by the Lone Rider before he can be finished off. Marshall has his daughter, Virginia, come to town with the money and arranges it to be kept with the Lone Rider for safe keeping, but later Marshall is murdered by a henchman of Gowdey&#39;s and the blame is placed on the Lone Rider&#39;s identity, Rocky Cameron and Fuzzy. The only way to save themselves is to prevent the next buyer from falling into Gowdey&#39;s trap. An OK B-western with an pretty good plot for PRC. Much of the film is saved Fuzzy St. John&#39;s antics (like many other PRC productions)and the rest of the cast and production are nothing to rave about. Always find it strange, that Livingston spends more time as Rocky rather than the Lone Rider, but I&#39;m not complaining. Rating, based on b-westerns, 5.","Gowdey's scheme is to repeatedly sell a ranch by mail and to tell the buyer to bring the money in cash. His men then kill the buyer and keep the cash.

It is actually kind of sad and poignant. Not something you would expect from the Madam of Hollywood, who did business with some of the most powerful people in the industry.

Anyone who isn&#39;t an avid fan of micro budget indie film will be the first to tell you digital video doesn&#39;t look professional and is distracting. I tend to agree. I can&#39;t usually get absorbed into films like Inland Empire simply because of the format they are shot on. This is where Horrocks has done something rare and spectacular by making his budgetary restrictions really work for him. From the opening scene the film is instantly engaging and enthralling. The subject matter is challenging and not for everyone but rewarding nonetheless. The locations all look hauntingly familiar and yet skewed, like a bizarre dream. The score is superb and didn&#39;t rely on bombastic fanfare to elevate every key scene. The cast, especially Tim Scott- Walker did a fantastic job with the complex material and should be applauded for making some of these odd-ball characters so believable. There were a couple of lines in places with slightly clunky delivery but beyond that, I cannot find fault anywhere. Would it have benefited from having a much larger budget? Probably but It wouldn&#39;t make it any more or less watch-able. It&#39;s refreshing to see a director proving that buckets of cash aren&#39;t necessary to make a brilliant film, just a great story and a dedicated cast/crew.This is a definitely a director to watch out for. I imagine he could continue making little indie gems like this or move seamlessly on to big productions like Lynch or Nolan. I highly recommend anyone who loves film to seek this out.","Dr David Wright's emotional torment now prevents him from functioning as a therapist.

It was originally titled &quot;Stickin Together&quot; when it aired on TV in 1978, and led to a short-lived series called &quot;The MacKenzie&#39;s of Paradise Cove&quot; in the spring of 1979. I couldn&#39;t wait to see it again! I loved the movie and the series when I was a kid. It was a great family drama, and the Hawaiian scenery was beautiful. The kids were all talented actors and Clu Gulager was great as the beach bum they recruit to act as their uncle. He reminded me of Brian Keith. This movie is definitely worth checking out, and I wish someone would release the series on DVD as well.","Cuda Weber is a Hawaii beach bum who finds himself the surrogate uncle to five orphaned children and tries to keep them together as a group.",,"tt0078322"

When Phyllis is eighteen, the Squire takes her to London, where she is to be made his wife. His sister, Alithea, goes with them. The Squire intends Alithea for Sparkish, a boon companion of his. In London Phyllis meets Belville, a handsome youth. They fall in love. Alithea is attracted to young Harcourt, and the idea of marrying their aged suitors becomes unendurable to both the girls. The Squire schemes to break off the affair between his ward and Belville. At his dictation, she writes her lover a note, telling him that she detests him and hopes she may never see him again. But at the last moment, she substitutes another note she has written, urging Belville to have a minister in readiness so that she may escape and marry him. The Squire delivers the letter. On his return, Phyllis pretends to him that it is not she, but Alithea, who loves Belville. The Squire, overjoyed, writes Belville his full consent to his marriage ""with this lady,"" and Phyllis, disguised in Alithea's mantle, hat and veil, is the bearer of the note. Thus, she keeps the tryst and she and Bellville are married. The old Squire has no choice left but to realize that youth must wed with youth.

This reduces actresses to sex workers and is not ready for the public.That&#39;s because the players are encouraged to delve into the tricks of their trade, with the most egregious example tarnishing the reputations of two favorites of mine: Elexis Monroe and Chastity Lynn. They interview each other with Lynn already wearing her trusty strap-on dildo, and the subject is anal sex - you know, how does a pro control her dining habits to ensure cleanliness in front of the camera, etc. It&#39;s about as interesting to listen to as some doctor describing how he goes about performing a colonoscopy.When the segment belatedly turns to sex, Lynn goes all gonzo, immediately attacking Elexis&#39;s posterior, and then apologizing to Girlfriends&#39; honcho Dan O&#39;Connell for the resulting footage.

They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content.1939, like all the other years for Terrytoons, saw a hit and miss batch, more so than the other years even. Of which &#39;Billy Mouse&#39;s Akwakade&#39; is one of the better ones ranking it in correlation with the rest of the Terrytoons and one of the best 1939 cartoons. There are flaws but also a lot of strengths, and a few things done better than what was seen before. &#39;Billy Mouse&#39;s Akwakade&#39; is well worth watching as an above average watch with more to it than completest sake.Best asset is the music, which predictably is incredible. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. The ambitious, elaborate detail in the backgrounds is still great to see, the Terrytoons at this point showed more fluidity in design than in previous years and some synchronisation is neat. The drawing is more fluid generally and the colour vibrant. The sound has also gotten much sharper and clearer.A fair share of amusing moments, with more gags than there can be usually found and they are all beautifully timed and funny (not always the case with Terrytoons), and there is a lot of zest and natural charm. Also a suitably strange and absurdist quality that was fun and endearing to watch. The characters are amusing and interesting, with the mice not too bland (mice tended to be portrayed rather blandly with Terrytoons), and that the cartoon doesn&#39;t get saccharine is appreciated. There are imaginative visuals and moments (Terrytoons very rarely used water so inventively), some nice touches and it was difficult to not have fun with all the aquatic antics.On the other hand, there are occasions where transitions and drawings are not as smooth as they could have been.&#39;Billy Mouse&#39;s Akwakade&#39; also to me took a little time to get going. The story is barely existent.All in all, above average and worth a watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox","The title is a take-off parody of Billy Rose's Aquacade, and uses an ordinary bathtub, as aqua-mice perform aquatic ballet dances and water sports.

It was based on the novel which tells about a Swiss professor called Raimund who saves a young woman from jumping off the bridge. Then the girl disappears, so the Raimund got her red coat and a book. He starts to read it to find why she was trying to kill herself. That he finds something deep inside which is more than he had in his life. So he abandons his class in half way and pursue the thrilling adventurous quest to find more about the person he read in the book. Everything he was curious about is only grows bigger than he imagined. He meets many people regarding that book and they tell the same stories from each of their own perspectives which happened in back 70s. Now, Rainmund asks one question himself after knowing everything and it might be yours too if you saw the movie.The movie looked exact copy of a novel, like I read some novel. The story telling which transforms the screen constantly between now and 70s were clearly maintained with its destination until the last 10- 20 minutes. Once you know the final conclusion, you may say is that it&#39;s because some of you might expect something bigger. But the middle aged or older guys who had experienced life very well will know the meaning of it. Yeah I believe the movie might more suitable for those kinda audience than youngsters.It was a nice performance by such a great British actor Jeremy Irons. Like I said the story had two diversions, one which set in present time and another in 70s. The present time tale was totally ruled by Jeremy Irons, I liked it more than the 70s tale. The problem with flashback story was its ending, it was very simple especially I expected bit detailed explanation behind character Amadeu&#39;s death. And also his failed relationship with Estafania could have been more reasonable. However I am not disappointed with the movie, it was a quite nice drama, in fact awesome. I am not a book fanatic but I love movies based on the novels especially movie like &#39;Night Train to Lisbon&#39; I won&#39;t miss. I say you must go for it if you like the movies which gives more priority to innovative characters than usual theme.8/10",,"€7,700,000.00","tt1654523"

As one of the earliest productions released by ITC, it established the formula that would lead to a string of successful, and more well remembered, programmes in the 1960s. Taking its name from the popular novel by pulp fiction author Edgar Wallace, the series rejected the ruthless vigilantism of the book, opting instead for an entirely different approach to the basic concept.The opening episode of the series establishes the premise. When four friends, journalist Tim Collier (Dan Dailey), British MP Ben Manfred (Jack Hawkins), law professor Jeff Ryder (Richard Conte) and wealthy hotelier Ricco Poccari (Vittorio De Sica), who have not all been together since World War II, arrive for a reunion at the country home of a fifth friend, Colonel Cyril Bacon (Anthony Bushell) they discover that Bacon has died and left them a unique bequest. Bacon believed that four just men could change the world, and has bequeathed his fortune to the others so that they may use it to pursue the cause of justice wherever they find it. The newly christened Four Just Men take up this call to arms, dedicating themselves to a battle that will carry them across the next 38 episodes, and over a territory that varies both geographically and thematically.If one word was required to sum up the concept of the programme, it would be &quot;diversity&quot;. With Collier based in Paris, Manfred in London, Poccari in Rome and Ryder in New York, the series offered our heroes a wide range of venues in which to operate. The generous amount of location work prefilmed in Europe and Britain featuring the regular cast and inserted into the episodes throughout the run certainly helped to give the series the look of a high budget production and maintain the cosmopolitan atmosphere. This international flavor would become a trademark of later ITC productions such as DANGER MAN, THE SAINT and THE CHAMPIONS.The adventures the Four Just Men undertook also varied widely in nature. There were, of course, the usual assortment of murderers, swindlers, thieves, gangsters and foreign agents that one expected in such a series. However many episodes discarded such explicit villains and instead probed into the greyer and often grimmer areas of social injustice and human frailty, including racial hatred, moral intolerance and the persecution of the innocent by the ignorant.Even the cast varied week by week. Each episode featured only one of the main stars in a central role, with maybe one or two of the others appearing briefly in a, usually literally, phoned in cameo. Each lead also had his own supporting cast member. Future AVENGERS star Honor Blackman appeared as Collier&#39;s girlfriend and assistant, Nicole. Hammer film actor Andrew Keir was Manfred&#39;s private secretary, Jock. Beautiful Lisa Gastoni featured regularly as Poccari&#39;s secretary Giulia, and June Thorburn occasionally appeared as Vicky, one of Jeff Ryder&#39;s law students. For the record the tally is Dailey 22 episodes, 10 as the featured lead, Hawkins 23 episodes, 9 as the lead, Conte 23 episodes, 10 as the lead and De Sica 15 episodes, 9 as the lead. Honor Blackman appeared in 10 episodes, Andrew Keir in 7, Lisa Gastoni in 6 and June Thorburn in only 4, plus one early appearance in another role before she was recast as Vicky.The guest players were also an impressive assortment of familiar faces and future stars, including Cec Linder, Sheila Allen, Laurence Payne, John Van Eyssen, Patrick Troughton, Charles Gray, Jane Asher, Jack May, Judi Dench, Anthony Bushell, Ronald Howard, Ronald Leigh Hunt, Donald Pleasence, Kevin Stoney, George Pastell, Lionel Jeffries, Michael Ripper, Ewen Solon, Ferdy Mayne, Robert Shaw, Richard O&#39;Sullivan, Philip Latham, Paul Eddington, George Pravda, Roger Delgado, Geoffrey Keen, Brian Worth, Alan Bates and Mai Zetterling. Special mention must be given to future ARE YOU BEING SERVED star, Frank Thornton who seemed to turn up in just about every second episode playing such characters as Desk Clerk, Auctioneer, Estate Agent, Police Constable, Hotel Manager, etc In one or two episodes his character even got to have a name.Undoubtedly due to its black and white filming and half hour format, THE FOUR JUST MEN did not enjoy the same extensive syndication other ITC series did after its initial release, and has unjustly faded into dimming memory and near obscurity. Fortunately the entire 39 episode run has recently been collected into a superb DVD release, so that modern audiences may enjoy and appreciate this classic television series.","Four men: a British politician, an American journalist in Paris, a lawyer in the U.S., and a Roman hotelier, band together to fight injustice wherever they find it.Four men: a British politician, an American journalist in Paris, a lawyer in the U.S., and a Roman hotelier, band together to fight injustice wherever they find it.",,"tt0052468"

In other words, all the time I spent on the rest of the film was wasted! Betty Compson stars in this early talkie from RKO films. It begins just before WWI and she is in love with a German guy. But, their love is interrupted by the outbreak of the war and, without explanation, she leaves him. Suddenly, she is meeting with folks in German intelligence--it turns out she&#39;s a spy! Now why she broke up with this German I couldn&#39;t understand...but oh well.Her mission is to go to Gibralter to infiltrate the home of the fortress&#39; commander in order to steal some secrets. She impersonates a lady who you assume the Germans have killed. Soon after arriving, however, her old German boyfriend turns up--and he&#39;s wearing a British uniform!! Huh?! Talk about a crazy coincidence. And you are now wondering WHO is won WHAT side. This wasn&#39;t bad...but baffling.Unfortunately, how all this worked out in the end was COMPLETELY baffling. Suddenly the writers were faced with the problem of trying to get Betty and her old boyfriend back together. And, they couldn&#39;t let them do anything to kill thousands of British sailors (after all, this ISN&#39;T very romantic). So, it results in the most contrived and ridiculous ending I&#39;ve ever seen. Characters literally do 180 degree turns and behave in ways that just seemed to come out of left field--and you have no idea what&#39;s happening. It seriously looked like the ending was just improvised at the last minute and so much of it violated what you&#39;d already seen in the first 80% of the film!! How infuriating! In addition to the frustrating of seeing the convoluted plot, the film also had exceptionally poor sound--which seemed to come and go. It&#39;s all pretty sad, as the film WAS pretty good up until the end and up until the sound started disappearing! Not worth your time.","During World War 1, German spies will stop at nothing to spy on the allied war plans stored at Gibraltar.During World War 1, German spies will stop at nothing to spy on the allied war plans stored at Gibraltar.",,"tt0021001"

A young kid gets into a street fight just as a boxing manager happens to be passing by. Liking what he sees, the manager vows to turn the fiery youngster into a star.Halfway through the film, however, the &quot;rags to riches&quot; storyline begins to turn and a much deeper side is revealed. More than a decade before the civil rights movement became a large issue in American society, &quot;The Ring&quot; tackled head-on topics such as stereotypes and racial discrimination.The issues raised are still very relevant today, 56 years after this film was made. Are professional sports truly a way out for impoverished minorities? Or just an unobtainable illusion? And is becoming white the only way for minorities to become accepted into our society? (What could be whiter than a ring name of Tommy Kansas?) All this and a young Rita Moreno, too!...as the &quot;girl next door&quot; love interest.&quot;The Ring&quot; is not a perfect 5 star film, but it was a movie truly ahead of its time. If you give it a try sometime I think you will be pleasantly surprised.","A young American of Mexican decent in East Los Angeles, California uses the boxing ring to make a better life for himself and his family, and learns as much about being a Latino in a white society as he does about boxing.A young American of Mexican decent in East Los Angeles, California uses the boxing ring to make a better life for himself and his family, and learns as much about being a Latino in a white society as he does about boxing.",,"tt0045091"

However, as a film instructor and as somebody who&#39;s critical of amateurish productions, I can assure you that this film is a remarkable debut effort by Nick and his crew of young filmmakers.And don&#39;t just take my word for it. &quot;Senior Prom&quot; is an official selection of the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival - no small feat for an 80-minute student-produced feature film. While there is much that could be improved on in terms of the fundamental technical aspects of the production (consistent audio and lighting, for example), some of these &quot;flaws&quot; actually enhance the mockumentary feel of the film. Still, there are a couple of times where these shortcomings detract.Yet, this is a wonderfully entertaining movie. Remarkably, Terry has gathered together a young cast who is exceedingly adept at improvising and inhabiting &quot;Senior Prom&#39;s&quot; characters in an authentic way. Much credit, too, goes to Terry for his script and directing because there are wonderful payoffs that could emerge only from well-conceived writing, directing and editing.Finally, I appreciate the tone that Terry takes with his subject. This is an honest, and at times painful, account of the experiences of a typical high schooler&#39;s senior year. For American audiences - young and old - the characters will seem familiar and the conflicts will ring true. And that&#39;s the point. Terry has allowed us to revisit the familiar in order to see it anew.

Things that are actually way creepy and/or disturbing are played for laughs, for example:old-fashioned clichés forced upon the viewer include having an indiscriminate playboy (Chin Shih-Wu) fall for a near-virginal Japanese girl (Tatsumi Chie), whose purity of heart and earnest innocence no doubt compel him to abandon his reckless, emotionally stunted, promiscuous ways. To add insult to injury, the near-virginal girl initially fawns over a douchebag in a suit (i.e. the financially secure but boring guy), and is heartbroken when he doesn&#39;t propose (girls just always want a ring on their finger, don&#39;t ya know).Amidst these pathetic story lines (compounded by some really pathetic dialogue), the only saving grace were a few well-timed and refreshingly funny jokes, plus Chin Shih-Wu&#39;s barely- concealed smirk for having carte blanche to do absolutely no real acting whatsoever. He merely prances around in flashy suits and flaunts his pecs.For a film about sexual conquests and awakenings, where was the chemistry between any of the characters, the steamy innuendos, the sensual vibes, or the actual sex? I would&#39;ve killed for random scenes between Chin Shih-Wu and any of the two dozen women he picks up throughout the drama-- or between him and Tatsumi&#39;s quirky friend (also the token ethnic minority, who conveniently disappears the minute Tatsumi and Chin sink into a trite state of happily-ever-after-ness).In this sense, it really reminded me of that most disingenuous of romcoms that also has &quot;love&quot; in the title but completely denigrates the concept-- yes, the perplexingly much-loved turd, Love Actually. Well, Crazy, Stupid, Amateur has joined the ranks, congrats!My rating is 1 out of 10.",,,"tt2337458"

To enjoy the many fine qualities of the movie, you have to shrug-off the many small absurdities and filler in the plot. For example the story tells us that the two leads are expert experienced outdoors-men and trackers, so I believe it. Thus, it doesn&#39;t bother me when I see some amateurish moves on their part — like letting some bad guys walk away from an encounter in a saloon; and being shot at in the open so many times and surviving unhurt. There are a lot of unlikely plot coincidences that I just brush off.I know IMDb has its own method to get a rating average, but I think this film should have a higher average. I see that about 150 voters gave 6 or better, and about 75 gave it 5 or worse — so how did it end up with a 5.7 average? For me the movie is an unexpected pleasure.

In their suits they also look like modern hipsters. So they come off more as the annoying douchebags you can find in every bar in Berlin today. Maybe they thought it was &quot;racist&quot; to let these guys sound as if they were from Russia, but it s not fitting at all especially since this is kind of a time piece.Equally fatal is the decision to put Matthias Schweighöfer in the main role. His acting style is polarizing anyways (imagine a 30 year old man talking, grinning and gesturing like a child actor as Macaulay Culkin, but many think its &quot;sweet&quot;), but here it looks like he intentionally avoided to give his role any depth with his constant frolicking and grimacing.

At his death, there was a long period where no one knew who would be inheriting his huge fortune...and this was a big news story at the time.It begins with the death of some guy worth half a billion dollars. Who gets the money is unclear...and a couple guys want to make sure they get at least some of it...which means finding the will and destroying them since they know they were cut out of the will. To do this, they kidnap the woman who likely typed up the dead man&#39;s will...but she tries to escape and dies in the process. To cover it up, they move the body and pretend she died there instead. Barnaby Jones gets involved to determine what really happened to this lady.This is an okay episode. The only thing that annoyed me, and it&#39;s very minor, is that Jedidah was dating a woman and they were in love...and like in every other show like that, that means you&#39;ll never see her again or hear mention of her after this one episode!","A grieving daughter refuses to believe that her mother committed suicide and hires Barnaby to investigate.

It was surprisingly short and beautiful!As the title says its about the romantic and coming-of-age misadventures of a 13-year-old African-American boy who moves to Germany with his dad and tries to fit in with the other German kids. He falls for a girl at a youth club and through her own growing up pangs encourages him to open up a little and share his rapping.We&#39;ve all had that one childhood crush that we fondly remember - puppy love! The director has beautifully narrated a story that captures the essence of growing up and not fitting in, our first crush and pains with our parents and their side of the story and made a pint size gem!

Unfair with his most faithful employee, Solange, his provider &amp; friend Daniel Rousseau (Comédie member Jean Chevrier), his devotional former girlfriend Anne-Marie, his current girlfriend Lucienne, all her employees, obviously his accountant, all his other girlfriends (she keeps their dresses, with tags for their &quot;periods&quot;)... but for Micheline Lafaurie, Daniel&#39;s bride. His new conquest takes the place of everything. His collection of course, some sort of respect for her in house ex, . But no, her place at his private wardrobe &quot;the cemetery&quot; as Lucienne aptly names it while arguing.Everybody must have their favourite character, mine is Gabrielle Dorziat as Solange, the only one that, maybe is not under the influx of passion, has a cool head to see all that happens, making things happen and being slightly grouchy and accepting, as it must be :). She is always putting up with everything, this would be her phrase: &quot;Don&#39;t try to understand, it&#39;s not the moment now!&quot;. Paulette (Fusier-Gir) is her sidekick, there is also plump &quot;Juliette&quot;, and stout Lucille, all vital for contrast with the beautiful women and the scarce male figures. For it&#39;s a women&#39;s world! Useful for us males to veer into something we probably would never have access to. The contrast between the customers (&quot;baronesses&quot; carrying dogs), the working women of the workshop, the models and the customers is &quot;social stratification&quot; put into good use. Françoise Lugagne is also perfect. The way she walks out of Clarence&#39;s says it all. In a film that feast female beauty one should not be afraid to be frivolous. My &quot;sexiest model&quot; was Christiane Barry as &quot;Lucienne&quot;, the sour girlfriend. Who has a fun paranoid scene at the bar on which the happy couple is having a date. &quot;They are poking fun of me!!&quot; she smirks to long suffering Mr. Murier, who only wanted his Camembert. The way she leaves into a cloud of smoke is a great brief scene! Not a great actress, she is given the best diagnose lines: &quot;you&#39;re a madman! And something about his end that you&#39;d better forget :). So is the lanky young blonde employee who hates Anne-Marie &quot;puritanical&quot;, she calls her in the beginning, and while placing the chairs in order for the collection, is instrumental into her fate, mind you.Jacques Becker made a time capsule of a little film, to be savoured in future generations. I can only glee in nostalgia by looking at the way people dressed, their naive pastimes (the ping-pong game followed by the huge family), and fashion that was actually nice to look at. And beautiful models, not skinny like nowadays :)!Art Direction, Costume Design (Max Douy), even hats (&quot;Gabrielle&quot;, not on IDMB) are well made! Music accompanies the scene and the &quot;suspense&quot; moments finely. The sound is pretty bad, as one would expect from a post WWII movie.There was one horrible dress, the one Philippe gives Micheline to wear for their first date. She says &quot;I look like a hen&quot; and she does! In the film it is shown that everybody approves of it, but I wonder ... :).Watch is as a portrait of a narcissist, if not for really being entertained.","A philandering young dress designer plays fast and loose with the hearts of all the fair maidens he encounters, and leaves them in a Paris lurch. But when he meets the fiancée of his best friend, he falls deeply and truly in love with her.

Turn off the brain, and sit down with the kids for a good solid family comedy. Vin Diesel plays a tough guy with a big heart, he just has to find it. In the process he helps to save the world and defeat the bad guys. The children playing the Plummer family work well together, you could believe that they could be a real family (problems and all). Lauren Graham plays the principal of the school and the &quot;love&quot; interest for Vin Diesel very well. Their attraction is &quot;cute&quot; but not overdone. Brad Garrett as the vice-principal provides the off the wall character that is often presented in this script formula.

Episodes involving the NSA in this series have always been biting, witty, and politically charged, and this one is no exception. It echoes, with some irony, the absurd &quot;war&quot; between the two countries in the South Park movie, poking fun at the longstanding, often comical, frictions between two neighbors with very different self-perceptions.The episode leans heavily into Canada&#39;s self-image as the cleaner, more polite, morally superior sibling: a nation with universal healthcare, less violence, and supposedly greater respect for civil liberties. Yet this carefully polished image begins to crack when we learn that Canada&#39;s Communications Security Establishment (CSE)-its version of the NSA-is engaged in electronic surveillance as well. And while the idea may sound like an exaggeration for the sake of the plot, the reality, in fact, backs it up.Although Canada lacks a Patriot Act equivalent, Edward Snowden&#39;s 2015 leaks revealed that the CSE ran programs such as &quot;Levitation&quot;, which tracked file downloads from sites like RapidShare, and &quot;Badass&quot;, which harvested metadata from mobile apps. These revelations confirm that, despite its progressive reputation, Canada is no stranger to mass surveillance practices.On the subject of &quot;hot mic&quot; surveillance-a core theme in this episode-WikiLeaks&#39; 2017 Vault 7 disclosures revealed &quot;Weeping Angel&quot;, a CIA-developed tool designed to turn Samsung smart TVs into covert listening devices. That backdrop of real-world digital espionage gives the writers of The Good Wife ample ground for weaving a layered and intelligent narrative.This episode doesn&#39;t just entertain; it provokes. It asks the viewer to question the lines between privacy and security, liberty and hypocrisy-no matter which side of the border you&#39;re on.","Alicia and Lucca travel to Toronto to represent NSA Agent Jeff Delinger who was detained by customs officers while attempting to re-enter the United States.

This is the typical story of most 1st generation Asian-Americans caught between the individualistic American Dream and the filial expectations of the Asian Immigrant Dream. As an Asian-American myself, I like that this story is straight-forward and simple without too many frills or manufactured drama (cough, cough, Everything Everywhere All At Once...) because this is our familiar, down-to-earth story that needs to be told.Who are we when we break out of our comfort zones yet return to our roots, express our individual uniqueness yet honor our communities? This movie gracefully dances its way through these kinds of questions, never arriving or preaching, but always showing and inviting the audience along for the ride.Meanwhile, the ride through Taipei is gorgeous! The cinematography with gorgeous shots of Taipei both during the day and at night was a highlight for me. It makes me want to get on a plane and travel there right now! My husband attended the &quot;Loveboat&quot; program back in the day and he said he only remembered Taipei being under a lot of construction as the subway system was being built. So he was delighted to see what the city has become through the sweeping scenes as well as the street-level shots.This movie is worth seeing with the whole family too! It is hard to say that about Hollywood movies these days so I&#39;m so happy to finally see a wholesome, feel-good film that doesn&#39;t try too hard to be &quot;edgy&quot; or something it&#39;s not just for the shock value. Honestly, all the big Asian movies these days depict Asians as either supernatural kung-fu heroes, loud-mouth comics, or filthy rich elite. This movie is so refreshing without these outlandish caricatures. Finally some down-to-earth characters I can actually relate to! We need more films like this to be made!These characters were brought to life by outstanding acting from the young cast, headlined by Ross Butler and Ashley Liao. There were no cringy moments due to over-acting. Everyone&#39;s performances were so natural and compelling. Overall, the chemistry among the cast was great. They did a fantastic job bringing this story to life. I absolutely loved Ashley Liao as the main character, Ever Wong. She could seriously act out a whole movie with just her expressive eyes. She was just such a natural, magnetic force and we hung on her every move, every glance, every emotion. What a graceful, classy, mature, and talented actress. I&#39;m a fan!Those who are diehard book fans may be disappointed with how the film deviates from the book. But as a standalone film, it&#39;s a win! I&#39;ve already watched this film twice and can&#39;t wait for the sequel!",,,"tt11947100"

This could be a great first date movie when your looking for a way to break the ice and stimulate conversation. I really enjoyed the skits as well. Each theme was given just enough time to fully delve into the topic without being too wordy. Then the skits help elaborate each topic but adds a little funny. It&#39;s especially refreshing to get comments from black men that are different than the regular negative stereotypes that are portrayed in the media. Especially with the current climate of the Sherman fiasco whom I support. These type of films are needed to help add more color to the spectrum of what is normally told about our community. I would like to see this movie get some more exposure in the near future. I&#39;m looking forward to more from this film maker.","A documentary that takes a humorous look into the complexities of African-American romantic relationships.A documentary that takes a humorous look into the complexities of African-American romantic relationships.",,"tt1904931"

OK we digress, but that is the most lasting impression we have of &#39;Together&#39;, a shockingly inept movie that can&#39;t quite decide what it wants to be nor knows how to get there. Billed as a rom-com, it is anything but, since it possesses not one shred of comedy – or for that matter, romance. Instead, amidst the construct of the latter, it adds in both mystery and thriller elements, but the awkward combination falls flat right from the get-go.There are two unrelated stories here, neither of which prove to be engaging. The first has action star Donnie Yen playing a police officer simply called Cool Sir, who falls in love with an amnesiac named Jojo (Michelle Chen) whom he stops for speeding one day. Turns out the paths of Cool Sir and Jojo have crossed before – as a recurring flashback hints – and that encounter had left Jojo with her current condition and Cool Sir with a rare inability to smile.Contrived though it may sound, we are still willing to take Cool Sir&#39;s temporary disability at face value – if only the writers had weaved a more convincing story between him and Jojo. As it is, we are not told why Cool Sir is drawn to Jojo (and would therefore break up with his on-off girlfriend played by Chrissie!). Neither are we told why Jojo&#39;s parents and best friend would seem to cotton on to their budding affinity at first, and then later on try to keep Cool Sir away from Jojo when her absentee fiancée of two years turns up unexpectedly.That mid-act twist makes the obligatory happily-ever-after ending even more unbelievable, and with such thinly drawn characters, we&#39;re not surprised that Donnie and Michelle share close to zero chemistry with each other. In particular, we pity Donnie, who must have taken a calculated risk accepting the lead role in a romantic film next to the considerably younger Michelle. Just about the most inspired thing that the scriptwriters could come up with is that absurd disability his character is saddled with, which in effect gives him an excuse to look serious all the time.Even more terrible is the other half of the movie, which pairs Taiwanese star Kai Ko with Angelababy. Kai Ko is Boy, the youngest member of an expert team of police officers specialising in wiretapping simply (or inanely), while Angelababy is Nam Lee, a fast-rising employee of a &#39;Newater-like&#39; company. Using just about the most popular social media app in Mainland China today (i.e. WeChat), the two bump into each other one day and decide to play a game to date each other for seven days but not to fall in love.Well of course they do, and insofar as the seven days are concerned, there is a fairly whimsical tone that fits the sunny personalities of both Boy and Nam Lee nicely. Yet again, the scriptwriters attempt to be smarter than they actually are by engineering a mid-act twist, this time in the form of Nam Lee&#39;s smarmy CEO (Bosco Wong), who Boy and his team are investigating for commercial fraud. That becomes the source of unnecessary tension between the two, with Boy filled with suspicion at Nam Lee&#39;s possible duplicity and therefore stalking her day and night. As with the first story, the twist is forced and superfluous, adding little to make the love between Boy and Nam Lee any more convincing. Yet unlike the one with Cool Sir and Jojo, at least Kai Ko and Angelababy look better suited for each other, the former&#39;s straight-laced act a good complement for the latter&#39;s spiritedness. Still, it is neither imaginative enough as a fantasy nor realistic enough as a real-life story, and displays an inordinate tendency to take unnecessary detours with needless supporting acts like Taiwanese star King Kong as an over- eager delivery man (whom Boy hires to send his signature pork chop rice to Nam Lee on a daily basis as well) as well as Benz Hui and Kingdom Yuen as Boy&#39;s parents.It isn&#39;t just the story that leaves much to be desired; the storytelling is just as dreadful. We&#39;re not quite sure why director Clarence Fok was picked to direct this – after all besides some cheesily entertaining &#39;80s movies, the guy has entirely no credibility in front of the camera. And &#39;Together&#39; is ample proof of his incompetence – individual scenes have little payoff; the transition between them shows no attempt at pacing; and worst of all, his idea of being romantic is as one-note and shallow as stitching together images of characters looking wistfully at each other in slo-mo while a sappy ballad plays (complete with lyrics at the side, we may add).Of all the all-star ensemble rom-coms we&#39;ve seen in recent years, &#39;Together&#39; is unequivocally the worst of the lot, a toxic combination of bad scripting and appallingly non-existent direction draining away any hope that the cast might make the watch worthwhile. Indeed, you&#39;re probably interested in the movie for one of two reasons – to watch Donnie Yen in an uncharacteristic role and/or to watch Michelle Chen and Kai Ko reteam in a movie. We&#39;ll do you a favour by telling you straight- off that Donnie is utterly wasted in the role, and Michelle Chen and Kai Ko do not even appear together (pun intended) in any of the scenes. So yes, there are plenty of reasons why &#39;Together&#39; is a sure contender for one of the worst movies of the year – and why anyone would break up with Chrissie Chau is a good place as any to start.","A police officer called Mr. Cool, who falls in love with an amnesiac named Jojo.

"Avatamsaka Sutra",,"[""Drama""]","This movie is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra, which is said to be the highest peak of Buddhist scriptures. The Avatamsaka Sutra is the most profound and vast scripture among Buddhist scriptures that mysteriously and majestically describes how practitioners reach the mysterious world of enlightenment of Buddha through the Bodhisattva path of seeking enlightenment above and saving all living beings below. In the past, it was not easy for the general public to access the scriptures due to the difficulty of the scriptures themselves and the barrier of Chinese characters, but now that the translation into Korean has been completed, anyone can read and practice the Avatamsaka Sutra. This film presents in very concrete detail through real-life examples how the profound teachings of the Avatamsaka Sutra can be applied and utilized in the lives of modern people. This movie consists of three episodes. All three films are films based on actual cases of using the teachings of the Avatamsaka Sutra in real life, and will be of practical help to those who watch these films.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5693558"",""name"":""Younguee Yoo""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5693558"",""name"":""Younguee Yoo""}],""title"":""Writer""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm3915149569"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm2388422913"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm2237427969"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm1516007681"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm1448898817"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm1885106433"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm2942005505"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm1583051009"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm1314615553"",""name"":""Avatamsaka Sutra (2014)""}]",,"11/30/2015 (South Korea)","South Korea",,"Korean","The Flower Garlands of the Infinitely Expanding Great Law",,"MWBTF","Color","Stereo","16 : 9","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/",,"Feature Film",,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32623101/mediaviewer/rm3396432129",0,,0,0,,,,,"tt32623101"

Dr. Denise Randall, a veterinarian, brought to Dr. Andrew Rigby most of the arm of the 18 to 25-old victim, on which Zach finds human bite-marks; not being cooked, that must make the cannibal sick. Aurora's sheriff Chris Scutter knows only of a missing hiker Ann Noyes. Ranger Sherman Rivers shows where he found the bear to harvest the excrement, which includes skin tattooed with an Indian Haida sun, which fits missing Richland college boy Adam Langer (aged 22), who has been missing for ten days, who, considering a career as a Ranger, visited Sherman, who flees into the woods, but only as bear poacher. Adam also took climbing lessons with Aurora's hunky private courier Charlie. The corpses of Adam and Ann -- missing the heart -- are found, shot in the head from up close, buried near a 'medicine wheel' made of stones, fit for a shaman ritual which requires two more bodies. Sherman points out Adam, Charlie -- and others -- were rivals for Denise. Zach discovers new bone markings. —KGF Vissers",,"tt0529895"

(David Calder) is a bisexual hustler in New York City. He&#39;ll do anything for money--but won&#39;t let love or emotion in. We find out why by flashbacks to his childhood where his mother lectured him that money was everything. Then he one day saves Jean (Donna Troy) from being beaten. They fall in love and decide to move...but can J.C. truly leave his past behind? It all leads to a negative ending.This was shot in the late 60s (&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; is playing and that came out in 1968) but it looks like a 1970s movie. There&#39;s tons of nudity and quite a lot of male frontal. There are a few sex scenes that approach hard core and a very negative, depressing nature. This might be hard to watch but the terrible direction detracts as does the lousy acting. Calder is tall, handsome, muscular and has a nice body (and went on to a long career) but he&#39;s a terrible actor. Still he looks great nude and that&#39;s all that matters here. Troy actually seems pretty good but she&#39;s hardly in the movie.In a way this is a time capsule of Times Square in NYC in the late 1960s but it&#39;s negative tone and bad acting make it a chore to sit through.

In this script, devised to be his testament, Guitry clearly chooses his heirs, not those who wish to make money out of his dead body (represented in the film by greedy Jean Tissier and Gilbert Bokanowski) but the woman (the adoration of his whole life) and the spectator (present and future). To this end, he has imagined a (thin) plot meant to revisit several of his plays (&quot;Désiré&quot;, &quot;L&#39;illusionniste&quot;, &quot;Une paire de claques&quot;, &quot;Le blanc et le noir&quot;, &quot;Françoise&quot;) in which two dimwitted genealogists (Jacques Jouanneau and Christian Duvaleix) are entrusted to check whether four happy couples who inspired him for his plays still live in bliss after all those years... Guitry originally planned to act and direct as usual, unfortunately he, who was too ill to complete his former film &quot;Les trois font la paire &quot; (1957), died before production was even started. Clément Duhour, a former actor turned producer and close friend to Guitry since 1951, seemed the obvious choice, all the more as he had co-directed Guitry&#39;s final film. Not so obvious when you consider the result. Of course, Duhour proves perfectly respectful and faithful to the master and he has managed to convince quite an impressive number of prestigious actors (most of whom being familiars of Guitry&#39;s theater and cinema) to appear before his cameras. But the pleasure of their company is not enough in this uneven film. The problem lies in Clément Duhour&#39;s incapacity to create magic and fascination. Luckily, a few of the performers manage to bring their character to life, the best being Gérard Philipe, irresistible as Désiré, the perfect butler who can&#39;t help falling in love with the women who hire her. Lilli Palmer is fine as well as the light companion of a French minister, Fernandel rather convincing in the difficult role of a white father whose wife gives him a ... Black baby! And Pierre Brasseur has the charisma required for being a Guitry substitute. But Jean Richard is absolutely inadequate as the man divorcing his wife because of his ... mother-in-law, Edwige Feullère is too stiff and cold for her role. And there is no real chemistry between Jean Marais as the illusionist and Lilli Palmer, the woman he is supposed to enchant by his lies. The so-so quality of Clément Duhour&#39;s direction should not stop you from watching &quot;La vie à deux&quot; though. For if, as I said before, the pleasure of their company is not enough, it still IS a pleasure to see Brasseur, Desmarets, Darrieux, de Funès, Fernandel, Philipe, etc. gathered together in the same film.",,,"tt0052363"

"Booky's Crush",,"[""Drama""]","The Thomsons - parents Thomas and Francie, and children Willa, Arthur, Beatrice (nicknamed Booky) and Jakey - are a loving working class family living in the Depression era in Toronto. It's September and the new school year has just started. Willa has thoughts of attending medical school after she graduates, despite the family not having the money to send her. Arthur is showing aptitude in drawing, and although his parents want to support his skill, Thomas in particular wants him to take up a vocation that is a little more stable. This difference places a strain between father and son. And Booky is reveling in her skills in spelling class. Although it's fall, spring fever has hit the Thomson women. Francie has run into an old high school beau, reminiscing on times with him making her think that she has been neglecting the romantic side of her marriage. Willa, the part time librarian, is attracted to Russell, the medical student she meets at the library. And 11-year old Booky is happy that she has been asked to tutor the new older sixth grade student, Georgie Dunlop, in spelling, since she has a crush on him, her first ever. She just can't wait for him to ask her to the school dance. But she begins to have mixed feelings about Georgie based on a gift he gives to her. Digging a little deeper, Booky begins to understand both the good and bad of Georgie.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609062"",""name"":""Peter Moss""}],""title"":""Director""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0285414"",""name"":""Tracey Forbes""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2208696"",""name"":""Bernice Thurman Hunter""}],""title"":""Writers""},{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2824757"",""name"":""Rachel Marcus""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001227"",""name"":""Megan Follows""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400949"",""name"":""Stuart Hughes""}],""title"":""Stars""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331298/mediaviewer/rm1825445376"",""name"":""Connor Price as 'Georgie Dunlop' in Booky's Crush""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331298/mediaviewer/rm971566080"",""name"":""Rachel Marcus & Connor Price in Booky's Crush.""},{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331298/mediaviewer/rm3052606720"",""name"":""Booky's Crush (2009)""}]","[{""actor"":""Rachel Marcus"",""character"":""Booky (Beatrice Thomson)"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2824757""},{""actor"":""Megan Follows"",""character"":""Francie Thomson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001227""},{""actor"":""Stuart Hughes"",""character"":""Thomas Thomson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400949""},{""actor"":""Dylan Everett"",""character"":""Arthur Thomson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257755""},{""actor"":""Sarah White"",""character"":""Willa Thomson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2767731""},{""actor"":""Noah Ryan Scott"",""character"":""Jakey Thomson"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2548759""},{""actor"":""Ariel Waller"",""character"":""Rosie"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1659650""},{""actor"":""Emilia McCarthy"",""character"":""Laura"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2264289""},{""actor"":""Connor Price"",""character"":""Georgie"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1161069""},{""actor"":""Albert Schultz"",""character"":""Mr. Spencer"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0776187""},{""actor"":""Marc Bendavid"",""character"":""Russell"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2544244""},{""actor"":""Marcia Bennett"",""character"":""Elderly Woman"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0071904""},{""actor"":""Brad Borbridge"",""character"":""Dave Juniper"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095980""},{""actor"":""Lisa Berry"",""character"":""Librarian"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2484864""},{""actor"":""Tom McCamus"",""character"":""Sidney"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564805""},{""actor"":""Chick Reid"",""character"":""Dottie"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1001758""},{""actor"":""Susan Coyne"",""character"":""Jeannie"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185452""},{""actor"":""Bill Lake"",""character"":""Mr. Jenkins"",""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0482126""}]","2/15/2009 (Canada)","Canada",,"English","Booky első szerelme",,"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Platt Productions, Shaftesbury Films","Color",,,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331298/",,"Feature Film",6,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331298/mediaviewer/rm3052606720",149,"Awards, 4 nominations total",0,1,10,"I remember when &quot;The Waltons&quot; first appeared on TV; it gave me a warm everything will be alright with the world feeling; people are decent, hardworking, and they come to the aid of their neighbor in times of trouble. It took place during the depression as does Bookys Crush. I can&#39;t say why but I love movies about that era. I was born shortly after it ended, but my parents lived through it and somehow always felt it would come back. One of the best reasons I loved this movie was that Megan Follows is a lead character. I have been madly in love with her since I saw &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;; Wow she was great. This film is about adolescent love and a family of four just barely making it. It made me relaxed and warm all over and I&#39;m not surprised that the rating is only 50% by others. I&#39;m just a sucker for these movies. I&#39;m a 67 year old man and this movie is for the 12 to 15 year old range.

This poorly made script could have been staged in less then an hour, but this slow, tragically bad acting most of the times lead to painfully long dialogues and scenes.I think this is a perfect example how not to make a movie.

Eightyone persons died. The hypotheses on the disappearance of the DC9 are three: structural failure, a bomb in the rear toilet of the plane, or an air-to-air missile which struck the civil aircraft by mistake during a battle between unidentified military fighters. Roberta Bellodi, a Sicilian journalist who lost her daughter on that night, and Corrado di Acquaformosa, a Deputy in the Italian Parliament, member of the Commission set up to throw light on the crash of DC 9, try to find out the truth, entangling themselves in a labyrinth of cover-ups, disappearance of proofs and key witnesses.

The single setting of the rural farm created an atmosphere of familiarity , mixed with isolation and dread..
Some of its secrets are given up early, but this is intentional, as it creates questions , in the viewers mind, about who is, or who isn&#39;t, aware of what&#39;s going on.
I thought Ken Samuels, as Gil, was fantastic as a troubled man dealing with his devotion to his community, while wrestling inner demons from his past.
His relationships, with the people around him, were fairly compelling, and existed upon a fragile foundation of pain and a deep sense of loss.
I recommend this movie. It isn&#39;t your typical horror movie, but I thought it was much better than some, more well known movies I have recently seen.","A serial killer strikes Sugar Grove, Virginia.

Their reunion at a bar takes a shocking turn when Charlie discovers that Jill is now Bill, having transitioned genders since they last met. The situation, while absurd, becomes a perfect setup for Charlie&#39;s trademark humor. His reaction is hilariously in character-shock mixed with awkward politeness, as he tries to navigate the unexpected revelation.This twist serves as more than just a comedic gag; it cleverly explores the complicated dynamics between Charlie, his brother Alan, and their mother Evelyn. Bill&#39;s presence acts as a catalyst for family drama, with Evelyn&#39;s reaction being particularly noteworthy-both surprised and surprisingly open-minded, a contrast to Charlie and Alan&#39;s awkwardly transphobic (but undeniably funny) responses. Meanwhile, Berta, the ever-watchful housekeeper, provides her usual sardonic commentary, gleefully enjoying the chaos alongside the audience.While the humor relies heavily on stereotypes, the episode manages to keep things lighthearted and entertaining. Charlie&#39;s confusion and his attempt to reconcile his memories of Jill with the reality of Bill add a layer of comedic messiness that works well for the character. Yes, the jokes lean into clichés about gender identity, but the humor feels organic and not overly forced, largely thanks to Charlie Sheen&#39;s impeccable comedic timing.It&#39;s worth noting that the reactions of Charlie and Alan might feel unrealistic in the real world, but that&#39;s part of the show&#39;s charm-exaggerated situations designed to maximize laughs. The episode pokes fun at the brothers&#39; discomfort while also giving Evelyn a moment to shine as a character who, despite her faults, displays a surprising level of acceptance.In the end, while the humor might not align with modern sensitivities, the episode is undeniably funny, messy, and in true Two and a Half Men fashion, it finds comedy in the most awkward and unexpected situations. A solid entry in the series that uses its premise effectively to deliver both laughs and a little bit of family drama.","Charlie's old flame Jill visits and has really changed: ""Jill"" has transitioned since Charlie last saw him and is now called Bill.

It often feels like the show is circling around the same issues rather than moving forward.The length of the season is also becoming a problem. At an hour and a half per episode, the pacing feels stretched, and by this point the repetition is setting in. Instead of fresh developments, viewers are getting more of the same: jealousy, trust issues, cultural barriers, and financial expectations.Yes, the drama keeps things entertaining on the surface, but without real growth or resolution, it risks becoming frustrating. It feels less like we&#39;re watching relationships develop and more like we&#39;re stuck in a loop of the same conflicts.Still watchable for the drama, but the pacing and lack of movement are dragging the season down.",,,"tt16992428"

"Pahlavan",,"[""Documentary"",""History"",""Sport""]","A scenario which until recently was considered unthinkable - excluding a sport that has forever been such an integral part of the modern day Olympics - has since the recent decision by the International Olympic Committee, become a reality, and the focus of Pahlavan, the documentary. A sport so rich in history, so diverse and inclusive in its participation, is facing its biggest challenge yet, to potentially be relegated from the competition that for all wrestlers, is the pinnacle of their sport. Pahlavan is the name of a documentary film that wants to tell wrestling's story. Wrestling is a sport that unites people from such diverse nations, that in some cases, are completely at odds with each other. The relationship between America and Iran is the perfect example of this, politically it has completely broken down, but in the wrestling arena, the two nations are as united as ever, particularly now that wrestling's future is in question, so much so that the Americans have invited the Iranians to America to a specially set up friendly wrestling tournament to showcase wrestling's uniting power to the world. Pahlavan will follow three broad story arcs. The historic event of the Takhti Cup in 1998 where the US sent their first delegation to Iran after almost two decades of a diplomatic standstill and the wrestling tournament last May, in New York between Iran and America. The final and concluding story arc will be about the upcoming IOC decision to drop wrestling from the Olympics. The decision has gained widespread media attention in addition to a grassroots campaign gaining significant traction on social media sites and among wrestling enthusiasts. Pahlavan wants to show that wrestling is not only a sport that is accessible to anyone, regardless of background or nationality, but a vessel for sports diplomacy, and that this sport can achieve something traditional diplomacy fails at. The word Pahlavan roughly translates to ""hero"" or ""champion"" in Persian. It is often used as an affectionate term for wrestlers in Iran, because the word doesn't just describe a person of great physical strength but also one with spiritual fortitude and a moral code of honour, a true embodiment of the Olympic spirit.","[{""names"":[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4702756"",""name"":""Yasha Malekzad""}],""title"":""Director""}]",,"[{""link"":""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3204330/mediaviewer/rm1214766848"",""name"":""Pahlavan (2014)""}]",,"7/15/2014 (United Kingdom)","United Kingdom","http://www.pahlavanmovie.com/","Pawnee, Persian, English",,"Tehran, Iran","Artist Preserve","Color",,,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3204330/",,"Documentary",7.9,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3204330/mediaviewer/rm1214766848",39,,0,0,,,"A scenario which until recently was considered unthinkable - excluding a sport that has forever been such an integral part of the modern day Olympics - has since the recent decision by the International Olympic Committee, become a reality, and the focus of Pahlavan, the documentary.

The big chunk of it rest in the screenplay. Have six people writing one single script will almost always end in a convoluted story line. They will add and cut stuff, they will argue and disagree and in the end will be so focused on details and forget the big picture.

For years there have been dolls and books about this little rabbit in the stores and there appears to be a huge fan-base among small children. I didn&#39;t really know much about Felix when I took my girlfriend&#39;s seven year old niece to see it, but after a couple of minutes I was actually appalled, that someone would charge money for such a mess of a movie. The concept sounds interesting and educational in theory. Felix travels the world, tries to find his way home and writes postcards to his owner, a little girl. While I didn&#39;t really expect much, I thought that kids might learn a few things about other cultures and countries from this movie. But the film was incredibly shallow, dull and silly. All Felix finds in the mountains is the Yeti, all he finds in Scotland is the Loch Ness monster and all he finds in Eastern Europe are vampires. Except for being non-educational, which can be a good thing in fantasy-movies, there are a lot of other reasons for not liking this film. The story as absolutely irrational. Characters appear with no proper introduction or explanation of their motivation. There seems to be a villain with unexplained superpowers, who hunts Felix without any reason only to change his mind a couple of times to save the main character. The dialogue is bad, the animation is even worse. An episode of Pokemon looks like a Disney-movie compared to this. The kid I saw the movie with enjoyed it, but I had no interest in discussing the reasons for that. I could ramble on for a dozen pages, but writing this seems to have the same effect on me as the actual movie: I feel tired.","Felix spends his summer holiday in Norway together with Sophie and her family.

Not too high for the reasons cited by the haters of the ep, but definitely better than they would judge all such episodes of good shows.","George has insomnia and goes to the diner where she finds Rube proctoring the other Reapers doing self-evaluation tests.

If that was Sabu&#39;s wife Harry Cohn must have cloned Gail Russell to finish the film.Gail who had an exotic look to her and played many an exotic role is an Indian princess from newly freed India. A point was made of that during the film, nice they acknowledged contemporary events. She&#39;s betrothed to a neighboring prince Turhan Bey who has decided to break an ancient taboo and hunt in a forbidden jungle.The local natives live in harmony with the animals and I assume are on Vegan diets. Also living in the village is the last descendant of the previous dynasty before Turhan Bey took over the kingdom and that would be Sabu.Song Of India has a nice charm of its own. I recall seeing this film over 50 years ago as a lad and I have to say I was as captivated then as now. For a B picture the jungle footage was well integrated with the studio shot stuff. Needless to say bad things start happening when Bey and his party enter Sabu&#39;s world. A dynastic power struggle that Bey never expected occurs with the prize a kingdom and the beautiful Gail Russell.",,,"tt0041898"

They spend an evening together talking about sex, masturbating, sucking one another&#39;s blood, eating meat like cannibals, beating up a little child, laughing maniacally at the casual violence taking place outside their apartment, and indulging in racist and sexist chat. Director Ramin Matin uses the entire film to satirize capitalist society and its tendency to destroy everything as well as sucking the blood out of their victims as well as themselves. Not much happens in the film; what we see on the whole is the four protagonists talking among themselves. The violence is implied rather than stated: gunshots ring out on the background, the characters are heard vomiting in the bathroom while the conversation continues uninterrupted in the living-room. Shot in deliberately washed-out colors, the film portrays a dark world with absolutely no hope of redemption. While understanding the director&#39;s perspective, I think the satire is a little obvious; although only eighty-five minutes long, THE MONSTER&#39;S DINNER begins to drag after an hour, almost as if the screenplay had run out of things to say. Shot in English - rather unusually for a Turkish film - its message should be comprehensible to anyone.","A satiric reflection of our contemporary global society manifested in the near future, in which two seemingly ordinary couples sit down for a dinner party.

My fellow German viewer was so passionate in their review that they forgot grammar and spell-checking. But since he&#39;s condemning Tony, it&#39;s only fair that someone examine his judgment of Tony. But a couple of things out of the way first.Ducky&#39;s character goes through some development in this episode and David McCallum gives a touching performance. Ducky&#39;s moments add drama to the usual light tone of many (but by no means most) episodes. The main plot, meanwhile, is sufficiently twisty to keep us watching with interest, although it&#39;s hardly groundbreaking. The usual high standard is followed, resulting in a 7/10 overall.In the end, I was left wondering, &quot;Why does my German fellow user get so upset?&quot; Tony&#39;s actions fall into the gray area at worst, but immoral? Hardly. Then there is their harsh 1/10 rating for this episode. And the fact that their claim of lack of character development is completely contradictory to the evidence in recent episodes. Even if my opinion is not considered, the plausibility that this episode would be a 1/10 is definitely approaching zero when you start to think about what 1/10 means: The. Worst. It. Can. Possibly. Be. IMDb Bottom 100 bad. Waaaay too many users throw ones and tens haphazardly, not realizing the extremes that 1/10 and 10/10 imply. It&#39;s a good thing the ratings of these people do not affect the IMDb Top 250 thanks to the undisclosed, but obviously effective filters and the vague &quot;only votes from regular voters are considered&quot; declaration. I&#39;d be willing to bet most of these extremists are not users dedicated enough to earn the status of a &quot;regular voter&quot;...","In Rock Creek Park, Washington, DC, a ranger hears gunfire and sees an injured man, who, identified by a thumbprint, is a Marine first lieutenant who became MiA in Afghanistan while on a recon mission six years before; Gibbs and company investigate. The gang talk with the two other Marines on that mission, and McGee and Ziva notice something curious, then a second wife with a different surname shows up. McGee learns that a PI has checked out the victim, so Ziva meets the PI and finds out who hired him. The victim dies of heart failure while in the ICU. Ducky finds an inconsistency.

Now they are no more, and the taste of the audiences changed with new generations. I used to think this movie will be just like usual 90&#39;s style stereotypical Bollywood movies. But it seems to be little better than these, and surprisingly I liked a bit.Ayub Khan plays as Vijay, a very honest cadet in Indian Military Academy, Dehradun or IMA who falls in love with a local young girl named Sami (no idea of her real name). Her strict mothers, who has a very tragedy history associated with IMA, and therefore doesn&#39;t trust anyone to give her daughter&#39;s hand. Besides them, there is also a local gang leader who is also crazy for Sami, and fortunately his corrupted Superintendent father favours him. On the other side, Vijay who lost his both parents in the very childhood, meets new parents to Major Rahim Khan (Kabir Bedi) and his &#39;begum&#39;. The most crucial incident happens when a new young girl Kavita arrives in the town who happens to be daughter of Saeed Jaffrey. The story takes a new twist turn and makes it complicated. To know more, better you watch it at least once.I personally liked the movie, and I really didn&#39;t expect much. But there are some very unique romantic dialogues from the three main characters – Vijay, Sami and Kavita who did their own possibilities to perform their best. Without any doubt, it is clear that this is the most interesting offer Ayub Khan received in his whole career. Other movies where he played lead role were not as effective as his role and performances in Salaami. The story writer tried to create a clear understanding between romance and military duty by emphasizing on Indian Military Academy, and it is reflected in the role of Vijay and Major Rahim Khan who continuously admire the military system. And there are several scenes involving cadets&#39; training. These show patriotic aspects of India.The songs were very popular in every music systems, marriage parties or crowd places during its time. The reason was nothing but heart touching romantic songs from Nadeem-Shravan. But it is boring in some way how the songs are frequently presented in the movie, which were not required. This makes the movie so long and bored to watch. It could be easily avoided. Finally, there are some dialogues from Vijay which he delivers with his broken heart, that give some reliefs for love failure people or who lost in the game of love. So, if anyone wish to see a good old romantic movie from Bollywood I would like to recommend you Salaami.","Vijay (Ayub Khan) is an honest young army cadet who finds himself battling the corrupt police department after he comes across evidence that could put Superintendent Gautam (Goga Kapoor) behind bars. And he also put himself in a situation which is all set for a conflict between the police and the army. —gavin@sunny_deol2009@yahoo.com",,"tt0403475"

Featuring several well known name actors/ actresses in which this is more of an ensemble as opposed to one central lead (however the L. A Slasher is the lead antagonist).The problem with the film is its style over substance and it&#39;s entirely illogical and senseless. We have this Slasher character taking hostages of several influencers and social media stars, Hollywood people (mainly young women with a few men) and he is broadcasting everything as a reality to tv deal. We see brief footage of random viewers watching on their tv screens what is occurring.Also several scenes of a reporter interviewing people on the street regarding this L. A Slasher and his doings. And each person is in favor of the slasher and his violent ways as they think it&#39;s all fake and simply a show (which is in part of a show but he is actually torturing and killing several people).What is most bizarre is how we don&#39;t see police officers trying to find this slasher and we don&#39;t see anything regarding friends or family of the victims. It comes off as if there are no officers. We do see some cops in the very end but this was well after many people have been tortured and killed.The film certainly tries being stylish and clever with its name prints in bright pink text of each character (ex: The Actress, The Socialite, The Stripper, The Drug Dealers) so in that part we don&#39;t necessarily care for any character. The Drug Dealers of Dave Bautista and Danny Trejo felt out of place with a brief twist in the end.Another major criticism is the voice acting of the Slasher. Voiced by Andy Dick was a terrible choice as he simply does not come off as menacing or threatening in any way, and makes the character seem more like a bizarre weirdo.In the end there is a slight twist which was rather caught off guard but overall this film is terrible, tries too hard in being daring and stylish where the substance simply isn&#39;t there.","Driven to rage over the tawdry excesses of reality television, a self-appointed cultural crusader kidnaps several very famous nobodies to make his point- but his crimes only generate more tabloid frenzy. —JWright Productions","$12,000,000.00","tt2735292"

The girls are teens and, since they live there, are kind of tickled to see a male teacher. They don&#39;t particularly lust after him, but they kind of crush on him. The title of the film refers to a baby that Chen minded as a favor in a doctor&#39;s office, only to find the mother left him with Chen. Chen has to take care of the baby and, inevitably, has to bring him to school and hide him, as he lives there also. At first this film is slapstick, then it becomes a lot more dramatic, which makes it a better film. Li Ching plays an old friend of Chen&#39;s and is a director there (by old friend I mean she knew him in childhood. She is in her mid twenties). Over time, you see a connection between them. She becomes less dowdy through the film and much prettier. The plot of the film shifts to the baby&#39;s real parents, which also makes it a better film. I do recommend this film, as it has comic, dramatic and sentimental overtones. Mr. Ho passed away less than a year after this film was released from colon cancer, so I&#39;m glad to have seen this film, to appreciate his acting ability. He is a good actor, and I would bet was terribly missed at the time. If you like Hong Kong films, or films by the Shaw Brothers, you&#39;ll like this. Otherwise, still check it out.",,,"tt0445598"

This ignites Constantine the need to help Chas in order to get the countless souls back including the daughter. The episode was more focused on developing Chas&#39; character which we haven&#39;t seen for the previous episode and I&#39;m glad we finally got it here. The flashback scenes were great transitions and showed how Chas&#39; life was greatly affected with his partnership with Constantine and how he got his powers which gives him more lives than his own. The whole Constantine feel is felt all through out the episode and it was very satisfying. The visuals were still intact and scenes which are meant for scares are well done. Even after the episode, I feel that Chas&#39; character will earn more important parts to future narratives considering the large range of stories in the Hellblazer comics. Just make sure the show doesn&#39;t get cancelled okay?Overall, it&#39;s an episode that focuses on character development and it does it&#39;s job well to entertain us whatsoever, +Character Development for Chas, +Visuals and Scary sequences, +Flashback scenes, - Might turn out to be boring for other peopleVerdict: 8.0/10","When thousands of people in Brooklyn - including Chas' daughter - slip into comas, John must locate and defeat the evil forces responsible.",,"tt4166524"

Ltd.","Color",,,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2487684/",,"Feature Film",6.7,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2487684/mediaviewer/rm1618435328",535,"7 wins",11,2,7,"Recently a 17-year-old boy, along with two other juveniles, was arrested and charged with ten crimes including that of raping a young boy at a soccer camp in Somerville, Massachusetts. His name became spread all over the media as articles, blogs, and message boards prejudged his guilt before any evidence was presented in court, typically proclaiming that the accused was a sick psychopath who deserved to rot in prison for the rest of his life. It was only after the media frenzy had subsided, however, that prosecutors admitted that they had widely conflicting accounts of what actually happened. Though some agreed that the boy participated in the attack, others said he tried to stop it, and still others said he wasn&#39;t even in the room.Though the facts of the case are as yet far from clear, what it may indicate is that situations that appear to be clear cut on the surface often turn out to be more complex than we thought and that knee-jerk reactions tend to obscure the truth. Such is the case in Tatsushi Ohmori&#39;s The Ravine of Goodbye, winner of the Jury Prize at the Moscow International Film Festival. Based on a short story by Shuichi Yoshida, the film tackles the controversial relationship between victim and victimizer in a compelling, though very somber story whose long pauses and lack of sustained dialogue make it a difficult watch. The film opens with a frenzy of media activity as police besiege the apartment of Satomi Tachibana, a woman suspected of murdering her own child.The child-killer suspect tells the police that she has been having an affair with a neighbor Shunsuke Ozaki (Shima Onishi), causing police to think that he may have convinced her that the child was in the way of their relationship. Ozaki and his wife Kanako (Yoko Maki), a seemingly happy couple whose sex life appears to be very active, at first deny that he is connected to the crime, though later Kanako shockingly tells police that the story is true and Ozaki is arrested and interrogated, apparently without the benefit of counsel. Watanabe (Nao Omori), a Columbo-like journalist, and his perky partner Kobayashi (Anne Suzuki), enter the case and try to sort out fact from fiction, discovering the fact that Ozaki, in his high school years, was a participant in the gang rape of a fellow student, Natsumi, with distressing consequences for both.The initial reaction to this revelation in the media is that Ozaki must be guilty of being an accessory to murder, even though no corroborating evidence had been presented. It is left to the probing journalistic duo, Watanabe and Kobayashi, to unravel the story which grows more multi-layered by the minute. The ultimate revelation of events that followed from the high school rape including what happened to the rape victim is startling and controversial. Needless to say, our initial impressions do not reveal the entire story which, as it unfolds, allows us to see the real people behind their labels. Though flawed in execution, The Ravine of Goodbye is an honest character study that has the courage to challenge society&#39;s patterns of prejudging someone&#39;s character before the evidence is clear.","When a sensational crime is reported and the mother is accused and suspected the press is beating down doors to find out more. The investigation takes a different turn when facts and backgrounds of everyone is examined and more revealed. Nothing is what it seems and no one is as they come. This is a lesson two reporters are going to learn soon enough. —aghaemi",,"tt2487684"

"Episode #1.11",,"[""Documentary""]","Jay Blades revisits three amazing inventions that have had a profound influence on the development of the film and video technology we take for granted today. First, a magic lantern brought into the barn by Marie-Noelle. She can remember her grandmother using it to show her images when Marie-Noelle was a child, but the light source has gone, some of the slides don't fit and the exterior is showing its age. Jay uses fascinating archive footage to show how the magic lantern was developed and used to produce some of the earliest sequences of moving images, using the same principle as modern day video. The second repair is a mutoscope owned by David Powell from Hampshire. The machine is like a flip-book: it rotates a series of still pictures past a viewfinder at speed to give the illusion of motion (again very similar to the basic premise of modern day TV and film). Jay explain the role the mutoscope played in the development of the cinema and how it gave rise to some of the first silent movie stars.

Leo, played by the magnificent actor Kim Bodnia, is gradually going insane as his wife gets pregnant. He feels his life fade away and asks himself how he can put a child into a world that&#39;s raw and how they can afford to have one.The atmosphere is two parts Scorcese&#39;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and one part Franz Kafka&#39;s &quot;Der Prozess&quot;, not very moody in other words. A sub-story about Leo&#39;s buddy searching for a girl relieves the pressure a bit, which is for the better as it also adds depth to the movie. The violence feels very realistic and is sometimes even hard to watch, it&#39;s like it all is happening for real. The realistic approach makes this movie feel fresh and not like something you&#39;ve seen before. After I saw this movie I was left with an uneasy feeling in my stomach and I knew I&#39;ve seen something very rear and very good.Nicolas Winding Refn is worth the highest of praise for making a movie like this. It&#39;s just what European moviemaking needs.9/10","Leo and Louise are a young couple living together in Copenhagen. Leo often goes out with his friends while Louise usually stays home. But when Louise tells Leo she's pregnant, a spark is ignited and Leo begins to become cold and distant. His anger and self-hatred finally erupt into violence against Louise. —Anonymous",,"tt0161292"

Unfortunately, &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; was disappointing and an example of an episode that never did much for me anyway in the first place. &quot;Orchis Fatalis&quot; got the season back on track, and was an episode that was better than first remembered. For me, &quot;Bantling Boy&quot; is one of the best Season 8 episodes and while not quite a &#39;Midsomer Murders&#39; classic it does have all the qualities that make the show so great.The production values are top notch, with to die for scenery, the idyllic look of it contrasting very well with the story&#39;s darkness, and quaint and atmospheric photography. Love the house, like a character of its own. The music fits perfectly, and the theme tune one of the most memorable and instantly recognisable of the genre.Meanwhile, the script is smart and thought-provoking with some nice quirky humour, lines from Barnaby that can be seen as sly digs but actually have a lot of perceptive truth to them (especially the much-touted one about killing for entertainment), a suitable dark grimness and good characters. The story is very compelling with some great twists and turns and one of the show&#39;s darkest, most elaborate and most unexpected endings. It is also never simplistic and rarely convoluted, though admittedly it took me more than one viewing to completely get the final solution.Acting is very good, John Nettles is a joy as is John Hopkins and their spirited chemistry together. Jane Wymark and Laura Howard bring charm and humour and the supporting cast such as Julia Ford, Simon Kunz and a contender for the creepiest kid on &#39;Midsomer Murders&#39; are similarly strong.While not quite a classic, &quot;Bantling Boy&quot; is one of Season 8&#39;s better episodes and a winner from start to finish. 9/10 Bethany Cox","Barnaby and Scott enter the world of horse racing when the trainer of thoroughbred Bantling Boy is battered to death.

He may apparently dislike the term, but it is hard to not say that about such a great presenter who has contributed significantly to some of the best programmes of the documentary genre and overall.It is really hard picking favourites, let alone a definite favourite, among what Attenborough has done because he has done so many gems, of which &#39;Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives&#39; is definitely one of them. &#39;Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives&#39; may not quite emotionally connect with me or have the wide range of emotions the way Attenborough&#39;s wildlife documentaries do, but it is still exceptionally well made and fascinating. As far as documentaries on fossils and evolution go, it is also from personal opinion ground-breaking and important.The final episode of &#39;Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives&#39; &quot;The Rare Glimpses&quot; is an example of how to end a consistently superb series. One where everything that makes Attenborough&#39;s work as good as it is is in sight and to dead on effect. A lot is covered without feeling like too much information is being given to us.Like as anticipated, &quot;The Rare Glimpses&quot; is very comprehensive, detailed and honest, is well-researched and doesn&#39;t make the mistakes of being one-sided or basing the information around poorly backed-up assumptions. Really cared for what was said and understood and appreciated fossils and evolution far more watching it. That&#39;s part of the beauty of Attenborough documentaries, when it&#39;s a subject one is not so knowledgeable on or usually indifferent to his work sheds a whole new light on them, clears up misconceptions and makes one appreciate and understand them more. The same went for his documentaries on invertebrates and reptiles.As always with Attenborough, his work and individual episodes of them, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; looks great. It is beautifully filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate, way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic with some of the shots being unique for a documentary series, making one forget that it is a series. The editing is always succinct and smooth.The music score fits very well, never overly grandiose while never being inappropriate while also being a beautiful score in its own right.Narration by Attenborough helps significantly. He clearly knows his stuff and knows what to say and how to say it. He delivers it with his usual richness, soft-spoken enthusiasm and sincerity, never talking down to the viewer and keeping them riveted and wanting to know more.Nothing is too episodic and it&#39;s all structured and paced beautifully.Overall, how to end a superb and ground-breaking (in subject matter) series. 10/10 Bethany Cox","In this final installment to the series, David Attenborough travels to four unique locations about the globe where an abundance of fossilized plant and animal remains have given us a detailed picture of what life could have been like in prehistoric times.

The movie, while being primarily an action film with supernatural/comic book elements, has great dialogue and narration throughout the film. While obviously special effects and a larger budget could have made the film more appealing visually, I would call this an all around success for the filmmaker. This is what indie films are all about and it is rare that you get to see a truly independent action film. Land of College Prophets is a film that any comic fan should see. I look forward to seeing more work from the Hale Manor team in the coming years.","According to Legend, The College Prophets are members of an ancient guild of fighters. Their story begins when Tommy and Rye, two violent brawlers accidentally awaken a powerful dark force in The Well That Ate Children. The well, created from the remnants of humanities inventions since the beginning of time, begins to possess the townspeople and poison their water supply. Only after their actions destroy everything they loved but for each other, they formulate a plan with the help of the other Prophets to set things right. Fighting with the wisdom of the Guild and power of their beliefs they correct their mistakes and prevent the world's demise. —Anonymous","$12,000.00","tt0451097"

The Angels go undercover at an all girls college called Blackmoor to find out who&#39;s strangling the students.Sabrina is undercover as an art teacher, Kelly is undercover as a teacher as well, Kris is undercover as a student, her being the youngest. And once again Bosley is the master of menial tasks, he works as a stable boy cleaning up horse poop.Audrey Landers, as beautiful as any one of the Angels, plays a total psycho out-of-her mind college girl selling drugs, booze, and pills. Her Donna Lassiter is about as unrealistic a character as imaginable, yet it&#39;s fun as hell. And considering that she&#39;s a total devil in this one, that makes sense. But the real question is, who&#39;s murdering the girls?Other than Audrey there&#39;s really only a handful of suspects. One is the creepy headmaster of Blackmoor himself, played by Jack Fletcher, who actually hires the Angels, and the other is all-around maintenance guy/van driver played by the menacing Hal England.There&#39;s a hilariously campy scene in Sabrina&#39;s art class where Audrey&#39;s character twirls the hair of Cheryl Ladd&#39;s Kris, only she twirls it so hard that she causes Kris pain. There seemed to be some genuine anger coming from Kris in this scene, pretty Audrey will do that to you.Later on at night, another girl is attacked in her bed and we have a scene with Cheryl Ladd in pigtails and a nighty. Can&#39;t complain too much about that look.Two other guests performances come from Elissa Leeds as the breathy-voiced Cissy, and Lori Lethin as Bo, friends and co-conspirators of Audrey Landers&#39; Donna Lassiter. Eventually Donna&#39;s psychotic antics are too much for them.These are the types of characters that only exist in an all-girls school slasher movie. We&#39;re talking about someone who has no problem burning down a barn full of people and horses just to cover up the fact that they&#39;re a drug dealer.When we find out who the strangler is, it&#39;s not a surprise, and if you didn&#39;t see it coming then you just weren&#39;t paying attention. Maybe Audrey Landers had you under her spell. But anyone could tell you that one little devil didn&#39;t stand a chance against Three Angels.",,,"tt0539249"

I sat down to watch this 2019 movie from writers Mark Pickering and Martin J Pickering with the understanding that this was going to be a horror movie.While &quot;The Witches of Dumpling Farm&quot; did have some horror elements to it, it was quite far from being an actual scary horror movie. Quite far indeed.This is not a very long movie, but it felt like I was sitting through a 3 hour long movie. Why? Well, because the pacing of the storyline was just atrociously slow. It took forever to go from A to B, and very little of any interest happened along the way.Most of the movie was just close ups of people looking at each other awkwardly, and it felt like 90% of the movie was just filler to make it become a feature length movie.The storyline was too simplistic to provide proper entertainment, and there weren&#39;t any surprises along the way. It was just a straight forward monotonous ride.The acting in the movie was adequate, taking into consideration the extreme limitations that was enforced on the actors and actresses in terms of a lousy script and storyline, and having essentially pointless characters to work with.All in all, &quot;The Witches of Dumpling Farm&quot; wasn&#39;t a particularly entertaining or enjoyable movie, nor was it a particularly memorable movie. I managed to sit through it, but was hard pressed to keeping my focus, and I will never return to watch it a second time around.My rating of &quot;The Witches of Dumpling Farm&quot; is a mere three out of ten stars.","After his wife throws him out for being promiscuous, Mark finds himself back at Dumpling Farm, a place of youthful memories and parties, but things aren't quite right. His old buddy Ian, who has never left the place, is possessed by a group of demonic, flesh-eating Witches. Using Ian and his farm, these beautiful Witches honey-trap Mark and his friends to consume their souls.","£15,000.00","tt8983294"

I&#39;m not ashamed to say I cried a lot over Bye Sweet Carole, a game that learned a lot from survival horror cult classics like Clock Tower and Rule of Rose. In a way, the experience was like going back to when you&#39;d spend time after school on your old PC/PlayStation with your cousins, playing 2D Disney-style adventure games, or those &quot;forbidden&quot; horror games, your dad gifted you. Leaving aside the &quot;moral&quot; aspect, from a mechanical standpoint... well, I can say that I was very satisfied with the game and personally, after having experienced many games that are no joke in terms of difficulty, this one gave me that &quot;cozy horror&quot; feeling (despite the occasional heart attack, aha). My favorite parts were those dynamic moments of collaboration between Lana and Baesie. Besides that... I admit that some points were quite tough to tackle (like Velenia, a very &quot;cute&quot; enemy, I can say XD) and I messed up the buttons a lot when I had to open doors or transform into a rabbit but... yes, I feel very satisfied with what I tried.

Possibly written, in part, due to the positive reviews last season when Joe was accidentally left blind. This time, Mannix is poisoned and an antidote is needed ASAP. Krumholz would soon write for POLICE SURGEON.Patricia Stich (as Holly) hires Joe to find her missing brother, a college student, the hunt leading to Hugh Beaumont&#39;s (LEAVE IT TO BEAVER) multi million dollar company. Beaumont plays Mr. Hammond who wants to know what sort of sordid stuff is going on behind closed doors at his business. The result: Joe is next on the hit list. Similar in concept to the cult film noir DOA (1949). Beaumont was a favorite of the producers, and as I said, had he not retired, he would have returned to the show many more times.As suspenseful as it gets, one of the very best episodes of the first four seasons. NO ONE is to be trusted here, even good guy Mr. Hammond. He&#39;s also surprised at the way Mannix is deteriorating.The makeup in this episode is exceptional, thanks to artist Jack Obringer who outdid himself. Jack did the makeup for 193 episodes. This story also shows THE terrific actor Mike Connors was in a truly sympathetic role. You really believe he&#39;s doomed.Look for Robert Ito (QUINCY) playing Dr. Yoshro who can&#39;t figure this one out. Sutton Roley, who headed 16 episodes, brings out the best of the cast, add some
bizarre TWILIGHT ZONE-like scenes, very unusual for this show. Roley also directed MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.Everything clicks. Should have been Emmy nominated for best actor, writing and direction. Hands down.Recommened by all us kids who grew up on Joe Mannix.

An alien Blob from another planet crash lands on Earth, and befriends a young boy. It turns out the Blob loves jellybeans, and will transform into any number of different tools depending on what beans it consumes. The boy has to ration his jelly beans as he and the Blob overcome obstacles on their adventure. It&#39;s a strong premise for a game, but it wasn&#39;t without its share of problems.In the original you had a limited number of jellybeans, which meant you could run out and get stuck. And though the 14 jellybeans were named in such a way to help you remember their function (e.g. apple = jack, and vanilla = umbrella) , it was difficult at times to know what beans to use or where to go. It was a clever idea sadly ruined by poor execution. The new version streamlines the design and tweaks it to be more player-friendly than ever before.Players will appreciate that they have unlimited jellybeans, which means you can experiment at your leisure. And rather than having to scroll through a list of beans with obscure functions, you can easily access available beans from a radial menu that displays exactly what form the blob will take if it eats the selected bean. The game further simplifies things by only giving you access to beans relevant to the level you&#39;re playing. You also have much more precise control when throwing beans, which is important because often the exact placement of a ladder, trampoline, or hole is required to progress. These changes alone make the fundamental experience that much easier and accessible, but that&#39;s not all.If you accidentally fall into a pit of spikes, for example, you&#39;re promptly returned to a checkpoint nearby, so mistakes aren&#39;t too punishing. And rather than having an open world to explore, the game is partitioned into set levels with clear goals. In the original, you could complete the entire game in less than 20 minutes if you knew exactly where to go and in what order. Now, there&#39;s a solid 12 hours of game play split between 40 main levels and 40 mini challenge levels. The challenge levels can be unlocked by collecting treasure chests, and you unlock concept artwork and videos by completing those. Completionists can always return to previously conquered stages if they happen to miss a chest. Rounding out the new additions are boss battles which punctuate each major area.Besides starting out slowly without a major &quot;hook&quot;, there are a few niggling issues which are worth mentioning. The first is that the game only stores game data for 1 player. The conventional save / loading screen is nowhere to be found. That makes it impossible for two (or more) people to play through the game separately unless you move the data file to a memory card using the Wii&#39;s buried memory management screen. It will also take a little while to become acclimated to the controls, since the game uses both the Wii remote and nunchuk (and its buttons). You do get used to it, though. Aside from these issues, the hit detection can feel a little spotty in some spots.What with the original game&#39;s design being majorly overhauled, you might think the graphics would go the 3D route. WayForward&#39;s titles are known for their excellent 2D graphics, and thankfully A Boy and His Blob is no exception. Rather fittingly, they&#39;ve given it a 2D hand-drawn &quot;Saturday morning cartoon&quot; look that fits the light-hearted adventure perfectly. Simple but fluidly-animated characters pop out from the painterly backgrounds. It&#39;s a style that closely resembles the excellent Wario Land: Shake It! (also on the Wii). The music is also quite good, and includes an excellent version of the original game&#39;s main theme song.The original A Boy and His Blob is considered one of the classics from the 8-bit era, but in all honesty I don&#39;t think it has aged very well at all. WayForward has taken the basic premise and updated it for the modern era, and the result is an excellent (if not quite perfect) game. It may not be as flashy as some of the other games out there, with its simplistic game design and cute 2D graphics, but it&#39;s a quality product through and through. If you own a Wii, you could do a lot worse than add this to your library. And because it doesn&#39;t really use the Wii remote&#39;s special functions, it seems like a game that should be ported to XBOX Live Arcade and the PSN network so that more people can enjoy it.","A boy and his blob makes it's triumphant return!

Halfway into their hike, the two learn about the slaying of another newlywed couple on one of the neighboring islands. The killers? A man and woman. Soon after, they encounter another couple on the trail, Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and his girlfriend, Gina (Kiele Sanchez). The four continue on the trail as a group, but it isn&#39;t long before Cliff and Cydney begin to suspect their new acquaintances of being the killers. There&#39;s also the shady hitchhikers, Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and Cleo (Marley Shelton, looking particularly nice with braided hair), who seem to be following them.While I was able to correctly guess the identity of the killer&#39;s just from watching the trailer, I still had a great time with this. The performances are really strong. I&#39;ve heard others say that Zahn and Jovovich aren&#39;t a believable pairing. I&#39;ve seen several instances of stunning women with less attractive guys, so that&#39;s nonsense. Aside from that, they&#39;re terrific together. This is a dialogue-heavy film with several amusing character moments thrown in, all of which the actors nail. Olyphant is the standout as Nick, a former marine with a bit of a screw loose. The humor actually works, the quirkiness adding to the picture. I also thought that the B&amp;W exposition scene was well-done, better than most of it&#39;s ilk. These types of scenes are generally frowned upon, but here it winds up being a highlight.The Puerto Rican locations (subbing for Hawaii) are quite lovely, though the dangers of the trail aren&#39;t played up as much as I&#39;d expected. It isn&#39;t an element that&#39;s necessarily needed, however, as I found the film to be plenty suspenseful as is. The killers were obvious to me, yes, but the I was more caught up in the situations than the reveal. For instance, the situation of the reveal made for a terrific moment. It&#39;s all in how it&#39;s done. While I could have done without the annoying screenwriter in-jokes, they don&#39;t ruin the suspense either.I&#39;d say that director David Twohy has more hits than misses, and this clever slice of pulpy entertainment continues that trend.",,"$14,000,000.00","tt0971209"

This time period depicts the Frenche Armistice and its inner apparatus leading to the appeal of 18 June. Some key historical and political figures such as Georges Mandel, Paul Reynaud and Marechal Petain are nicely enacted and help to understand the state of play at the time. Dialogues are key here and we follow the first political steps of a young Colonel, promoted as a provisional General, defending its views on France&#39;s dignity both admist a hostile and compromised French Government and a wary and concerned British ally. The depiction of the General&#39;s family life, both as a husband and a father is elegant and passionate. Yvonne character&#39;s is beautifully performed by Isabelle Carré, sensitive and strong, as much combative as her husband. The film follows her on very nicely orchestrated thrilling road trip. But the central character of the movie is their youngest daugther, Anne, born with Down&#39;s syndrome. The litte girl is key, impelling both husband, wife and parents to face the realities of war, survival and liberty. The acting little girl is wonderful. Is is noteworthy to conclude that the movie is the first based on the character. A must see.",,,"tt10880402"

The artistic CGI enhances the fantasy feel. I was blown away by the stunning music, beautiful set design and the heartfelt portrayal by the cast.Dylan Wang nails a challenging role of the heartless and ruthless but inadvertently funny and loveable Supreme Lord of the Moon Tribe, Dongfang Qingcang.Esther Yu as lowly Fairy Orchid Xiao Lanhua is initially annoying with her high-pitched, whiney, babyish way of talking but she eventually grows on you once you realize Lanhua is really a baby immortal, just 1500 years old compared to Dongfang Qingcang who is more than 30,000 years old. Now, before Xianxia newbies get dismayed at this age difference, it will be noted that Xianxia is a genre that deals with immortality and reincarnation, thus aging happens differently. In any case, Lanhua does grow up, becoming much less whiney and babyish as the drama progresses. However, she retains a baby&#39;s innocence and purity of heart, making her one of the most admirable female leads I&#39;ve encountered in CDramas. Instead of the usual revenge-driven grudge-keeping CDrama characters, Lanhua sees the best in everyone and is quick to forgive and forget. She does not hesitate to come to the rescue of other people, with no thought of her own safety. Her pure heart, kindness and courage melt DFQC&#39;s heart, or rather, restore his emotional tree.Roc Chen&#39;s sublime background music, also featured in Royal Nirvana, soars, a fitting accompaniment to the exquisite artistic visuals. The other musical pieces are equally stirring.In summary, it&#39;s a beautiful and powerful drama that dares to make viewers believe in the supremacy of love.",,,"tt14922556"

It is kind of stupid or just plain stupid; this is the story that most horror movie sequels try to rip off, the telepathic powers that get really annoying. It seems like every horror movie sequel has to have it, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street had it, why not include the Halloween franchise as well? Unfortunately I didn&#39;t get into it, I think because it was extremely unoriginal and not to mention that the story didn&#39;t really continue from the 4th sequel. The ending of Halloween 4 had Jamie turning evil, I guess they just totally dropped that idea which could have been great to see, instead we got a silly and typical horror story that was badly acted, edited, and directed.Michael Myers makes his way into a small shack by the river owned by a local hermit. Once there, Michael collapses and remains in a comatose state for a full year. On October 30th Michael awakens, kills the hermit, and returns to terrorize Haddonfield, where his young niece, Jamie Lloyd continues to live after nearly being killed by Michael the year before. Jamie has been mute since attacking her foster mother at the end of film 4, but exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her evil uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis realizes that this link exists, and plans to use it to put an end to Michael&#39;s reign of terror. Michael begins stalking Rachel and her friend Tina. After both are killed Jamie agrees to put herself in danger to help Loomis stop Michael for good. With Jamie&#39;s help, Loomis lures Michael back to the old Myers house. Michael makes many attempts at killing Jamie, finally getting the chance to in the attic. Jamie tries appealing to Michael&#39;s humanity by calling him &quot;Uncle&quot;. Myers pauses, prompting Jamie to ask to see his face. He takes off his mask, and a lone tear runs down his face. Jamie reaches up to wipe it away, and Michael is thrown into a rage. The killer pursues Jamie, who runs into Loomis. The doctor seems to turn on the girl as he shouts for Michael to come and take her. It turns out that he has used the girl as bait, thus leading Michael to walk beneath a heavy chain net. But you have to see what happens next by watching the movie.While granted that this movie isn&#39;t the worst movie in the world, I do enjoy the Halloween sequels, I think this was a fall in the story line for the Halloween series. It really could have had a lot of potential, but since they dropped a few ideas that were presented in the previous Halloween sequel. Not to mention this is one of the rare times that I wasn&#39;t scared by Michael, he&#39;s loosing his touch no, I can&#39;t say that, please I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s the writing! It&#39;s the blasted writing! So if you wanna see the sequels, yeah, do watch it just to see the story continue, but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general, you can skip Halloween 5.5/10",,"$5,000,000.00","tt0097474"

It is a rather hagiographic biography of a heroine of the Great War Louise de Bettignies who spied for the British in occupied France until she was arrested in 1915. And it has all the expected failings - sentimentality, patriotism, even religious fervour.But actually the film manages rather remarkably to transcend all that and become a very tense and interesting account. Strictly speaking it is a biofiction (the character is called Geneviève de Vendeville in the film and her fate differ somewhat from that of the real-life spy) but there is no doubt that it is based on de Bettignies. At one point we not only see the statue that adorns her memorial (her body was repatriated in 1920) but the director really quite elegantly recreates the tableau the statue represents (a soldier kissing the hand of a woman whose face is turned away) in the action of the film. And there are many similar elegant touches throughout the film, plus some very good cinematography and rather impressive acting.There is a very clever piece of audience entrapment where you believe a girl has been caught pickpocketing a German officer but as the officer approaches, his image changes to that of her boyfriend and she explains that she must have had a dream and has in fact completed the task and covered her tracks already (which the audience has not known till that moment). The escape across the border of a young couple is superbly filmed. The arrest of the heroine is also a brilliant moment.It even goes a little deeper than most hagiographic accounts of war-partisans in that it explores a sort of semi-religious desire for martyrdom that seems to inspire the heroine (she frequently envisages a violent death and sees herself at one point as Jeanne d&#39;Arc), which is entirely psychologically plausible. To offset her saintliness there is rather good woman villain (the German counter-espionage agent no, 125) who does her espionage while reposing elegantly rather like the detective who solves the crimes while sleeping in Carné&#39;s wonderful Drôle de drame.This film is is not a masterpiece but it is a much, much better film than one might have expected from its total obscurity and from its subject-matter. It&#39;s a good deal better, for instance, than Claude Berri&#39;s Lucie Aubrac.The version I saw was produced for the Pathé-Rural, a new non-flammable 17.5mm projection system launched in 1927 not so much for home-projection like the 9mm Pathé-Baby but for projection in halls in rural areas. It was renamed Pathé Junior in 1933 (and sound-enabled) but banned by the Germans in 1941.

That is unfortunate as it had so much potential in terms of stories, character development and good dialogues from time to time even though certain scenes seemed far-fetched and superfluous. Enjoyed the bantering and humour between the characters showing some electrifying chemistry simmering underneath which keeps the viewers in suspense.","On Election Day, Jay turns to Kate and the team for help after his parents and other voters are illegally intimidated at their polling place.

Yet it regularly does; Hawks keeps the momentum going majestically; it is one incredibly surreal, bizarre tangent going off unexpectedly into another, at every juncture. He photographs and presents his actors in the most charming and amusing possible ways, and the film is certainly a more leisurely, perfectly pitched film than &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, which I nonetheless admire. There is a beauty in the photography and simple choice of perspectives and angles that matches the There is not one actress in the annals of film who I adore more than Katharine Hepburn; she is a compelling performer, of great charm, intelligence and wit; of very real, idiosyncratic looks that to this eye are beautiful, vivacious, impish. In &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; her Susan Vance is a very interesting diversion from her more usual type of character - the slightly superior, in-control ice maiden, as shown in say &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. She is phenomenal in that film, yet here beguiling in a completely different fashion, playing a slightly scatterbrained, sprightly, charmingly delinquent woman, who seems to have no control over anything; least of all her feelings for Grant. Her giddy, breathless exuberance and anarchic helplessness are really endearing; it&#39;s a wonderful film that stretches out the credulity of Grant&#39;s wonderfully straight-laced character&#39;s resistance to Miss Vance. The ending is a gorgeous, satisfying pay-off, as he finally gives way, as would we all! It&#39;s a charming, suitable ending that rectifies the slight fall-off of the preceding jail section of the film. That is very amusing, but in a more predictable, slightly laboured way. In stark contrast to the first 70-80 minutes of the film, which amounts to about the finest sustained American comedy I have seen of that length - &quot;Way Out West&quot; and &quot;Duck Soup&quot; being shorter in total. Cary Grant, truly an institution of a comedic player, is very different to his more remembered persona of later years. It&#39;s remarkable to see this absurd little man, bespectacled, unworldly and cutting an orthodox figure played so perfectly by the suave Grant. This is gleefully played on with the sublime scene where Hepburn and Grant are trying to catch the leopard - Kate butterfly net in hand! She accidentally happens to break his glasses and is even more taken with him without them... The tension between how we usually remember Grant and the character he is playing here does add an extra layer of amusement to the film. Need I really add that the rest of the film&#39;s company are note perfect? Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald and many more really give the perfectly matched stars a fine backdrop.I shan&#39;t spoil too much of this heady, sublimely silly film... just go and watch it and see Howard Hawks, a master craftsman, at his best - there are no pretensions but making a quite wonderful character comedy - and Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on insurmountable form. With these delightful stars and anarchic, scintillating comic material, what we have on our hands is an unutterably fine film, one of my very favourites of all time. Where else are you going to get such plot threads running simultaneously as: a hunt for a rare archeological find buried by a dog, an absurd upper-middle-class family dinner and an escaped leopard?Rating:- *****/*****",,"$1,073,000.00","tt0029947"

The title of the movie is well chosen: &#39;Ciao&#39; can mean both hello and goodbye, and that is the essence of this subtle film. Written by director Yen Tan and actor Allesandro Calza it is a very contemporary story about love and enduring feelings. The film takes its time, very literally, dwelling on still shots of doorways, paths, profiles, etc while the message of the film slowly surfaces. It is more an elegy than a story and it works quite well. We first meet Jeff (Adam Neal Smith) as he is packing up the belongings of his longtime friend Mark who has just died, and in doing so he comes across Mark&#39;s computer and discovers messages to and from an Italian man named Andrea (Alessandro Calza), messages that define an internet relationship that ends with Mark&#39;s death. Andrea doesn&#39;t know about Mark&#39;s passing and when Jeff answers one of the emails stating that Mark has died, Andrea states he is on his way to the US for a wedding and that he had planned to meet Mark face to face in Dallas. Jeff extends the invitation to keep Andrea&#39;s plans, meets him at the airport, and invites him home where a long series of talks reveal the histories of both men and reminiscences of Mark. The mutual loss - one of a friend, the other of a potential love - mix and a new friendship of understanding and caring is born. Much to the credit of the writing, directing and acting, the ending is unexpectedly real - again recalling the title of the movie. Some will find this film too slow and too &#39;empty&#39;, but for viewers who appreciate still life paintings and poetry, this film will satisfy.

Doyle goes undercover as a journalist to investigate Batak&#39;s beautiful London-based daughter, who&#39;s studying classical piano at a college in the city.When Doyle comes under fire, it appears that Batak&#39;s return isn&#39;t as secretive as they&#39;d hoped - and a series of twists and double-crosses leave both Batak and his daughter in deadly danger.This is quite a workmanlike episode - not a remarkable one, but a good espionage drama where things are never quite what they seem.
Carol Royle is the real star here as the gorgeous Anna Batak, and gives an excellent and engaging performance.
There are some well-staged action set-pieces too, as well as some nice touches of humour - Martin Shaw&#39;s ad-libbed &#39;Burke and Hare&#39; quip makes for an amusing retort at one stage, and his brawl outside a church where a wedding is taking place is fun and well-choreographed.It makes for a pretty solid episode from the third season that&#39;s cleverly plotted and keeps you guessing till the end.","Stefan Batak, a Bulgarian who has been spying for Britain, is released as part of an exchange of agents, and CI5 are charged with his safety as well as establishing whether his information is genuine.

So, beside them, some other people start to live in the house: Edorta (Iñaki Esnaola), an antisocial guy that lives in his own room playing fighting videogames; James (Luke Donovan), a Irish guitar player that has a band in Spain and speaks Spanish in a very funny way; and Lucia (Diana Palazón), a beautiful Fine-Arts student that looks for a room At the beginning everything seems to be fine, but then the peculiar personality of each one will ruin their relationship as house-partners.

Not, of course, is it necessarily any better for that. It&#39;s a slight, disingenuous little picture veering uneasily from drama to comedy without making much of an inroad either way.Joel McCrea, (blander than usual), is the crusading dentist, (sic), and Betty Field, the wife who eggs him on. Some of the Sturges stock company pop up in sundry supporting parts, (noticeably William Demarest), but none make much of an impression. They, like the film, remain largely inoffensive. Not a failure, precisely, but a blip nevertheless.","In the winter of 1868, Eben Frost goes to a Boston pawnshop and redeems a silver medal, inscribed to ""Dr. W.T.G. Morton, the Benefactor of Mankind, with the Gratitude of Humanity."" Frost drives to a country farmhouse and gives the medal to Morton's widow, Elizabeth Morton who explains to her daughter, Betty, that Frost was the first person given anesthesia by her father, Boston dentist Dr. W.T.G. Morton. The story flashes back 20 years to find Morton being wildly acclaimed by medical students as the man whose discovery of ""letheon"" had forever ended pain as, before that day, even amputations were performed with the patient fully conscious. ""Letheron"", unknown to everybody but Morton and Elizabeth, is simply highly rectified sulfuric ether - cleaning fluid - easily obtainable at a pharmacy. By keeping the secret, Dr. Morton could be rich, but he had rather be poor than see a girl strapped to an operating table under the knife of Dr. Warren, and he reveals his secret to a group of surgeons in the hospital operating theatre. With his secret out, and all hope of personal reward gone, with the possible exception of proceeds from his glass inhaler, he gets the news that Congress has voted him a reward of $100,000, and also learns that the patent on his inhaler has been infringed. President Pierce, under pressure from newspapers inflamed by jealous medical rivals of Morton, refuses to sign the bill until Morton has proven patient infringement. —Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>",,"tt0036880"

The acting was bad, it was way over the top and the comedic timing was just terrible.The jokes were poorly written, and the story line seemed rushed, like it wasn&#39;t thought out at all!The video production was terrible, not just because it seemed low quality, but because it looked like they didn&#39;t put any effort in it to make it look good.This show wasn&#39;t entertaining, it wasn&#39;t fun, and it was not even the slightest bit funny. Usually when watching any comedy series I can at least find one thing funny or good about it, but not in this case.

This a strange one indeed.Set during the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes in Belgium. An American Gi, lost behind enemy lines, a young (19?) Belgium boy,surely he would have been fighting for his country already and a captured German soldier who they take prisoner. They go in search of the GIs platoon. That&#39;s the story, I won&#39;t go into anymore detail other than to say. The dialogue is spoken in their own language, German, Flemish and American and various French&#39;s Ukrainian. (all have the relevant subtitles so you don&#39;t miss the not very well written dialogue) it&#39;s moves from one scene to the next with no apparent connection, it does remind me of El Topo in that respect, I guess it&#39;s anti war a scene with 3 visiting senators taking photographs of a general and the GI and the Belgium &quot; partisan&quot; in the middle of a battlefield is surreal. Through to the shooting of a dog and subsequent eating of the pooch and a couple of Belgium woman throwing themselves at the liberating GI and the boy. It&#39;s all a mess it&#39;s badly acted, badly written. If I was to guess at the makers of the movie I&#39;d say that they were hippies with their own anti war agenda( fair enough) but it is a terrible movie, bizarrely because it is so bad it is very watchable. Now it&#39;s finished i do now think why did I waste my time.it&#39;s all pretty random 3/10.","An American soldier travels Belgium during the Ardennes offensive to get back to his unit.

The good side was full of women that little girls dream of being when they grow older like (my personal favorites)Debbie Debutuante and Susie Spirit the Cheerleaders(who as far as I know never lost)Tara and Scarlett the Southern Belles(who as far as I know never won,by pin fall anyway)and rich L.A.jet setters Tina Ferrari(W.W.E&#39;s Ivory)and Ashley Cartier. The bad side was full of women that went bad and became what girls become if they don&#39;t watch their step.Like the the very popular thieving street punks Hollywood(who has her own Erotic wrestling video business now)and Vine,the risqué garbed gang members the Soul Patrol,and the thoroughly psychotic,quasi murderous Heavy Metal sisters.These two big unforgettable nut jobs brought real working chainsaws and blow torches in the ring and used them to burn their opponents and cut up their belongings!For some reason the bad girl&#39;s seem to have more of the actual big wrestler types who either almost always won like the Russian Col.Ninotchka or the big marine Corp.Kelly or were so brutal the always got disqualified like the aforementioned Heavy Metal sisters.However the good girls got along just fine.There were those like Americana,Susie Spirit and Tina Ferrarri who pretty much always won,the tough cowgirl Dallas who routinely gave even the toughest opponents horrid,merciless beatings, and in the last 2 seasons there was Justice.She was a 6&#39;2 New York cop who crushed her opponents. G.L.O.W. is largely enjoyable,lovable,and entertaining and anyone will have a great time watching.If you want to get the ultimate G.L.O.W experience type in &quot;Manzerman glow&quot;in your search engine.On his website he sells GLOW tapes cheap,the service is incredible,and there&#39;s about 20 matches on each of his tapes!He got a hold of all 500 matches in all four seasons!","Wrestlers will portray heroes or villains as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series matches.Wrestlers will portray heroes or villains as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series matches.",,"tt0252462"

Everyone is miserable because they have to miss their planned activities and sit around in an old diner. D.W. and Arthur find an old radio and listen to a cowboy program that cheers them up. The program also gives them the idea to look for tools in the storage closet that could help them get out. The pair find a screwdriver and pliers and manage to get out. Meanwhile, Mr. Read has prepared a dinner from leftover food in the diner's fridge. The whole family end up having a wonderful time despite having to give up earlier plans. The episode closes with Arthur presenting his paper of perspective to his class the next day. He talks about how even though he missed his TV show, the more important thing was that he spent time with his family, something that will always be bigger and always mean more that a TV show. —Noah",,"tt0993058"

Not just in terms of its subject matter, but also its attitude towards many of the people who do what I&#39;m doing right now. If you think, as I do, that most movie critics have forgotten what it&#39;s like to just be a movie fan and seem to go out of their way to nitpick and tear apart movies, you may find this movie both entertaining and validating.&quot;What if your life became a movie... that you hate?&quot; That&#39;s the tag line on the movie poster for &quot;The Film Critic&quot; (NR, 1:38). It&#39;s a case of art imitating life and art imitating art. A production of Argentina, the movie is called &quot;El crítico&quot; back where it came from, but it addresses universal themes of art, love and finding a place in the world in which you are comfortable, regardless of what others think.Victor Tellez (Rafael Spregelburd) is an influential film critic who thinks a lot of himself and very little of most movies he sees. He lives in a Spanish-speaking country, but prefers to think in French. (His thoughts are audible at various points and are appropriately subtitled for Spanish-speaking and English-speaking audiences.) As Tellez attends a seemingly endless string of private screenings with his fellow critics, he then joins his colleagues in complaining about what they just saw. Tellez has a reputation for being an especially critical critic and is confronted and stalked throughout the movie by a young filmmaker whose passion project Tellez savaged in one of his reviews. When Tellez visits his niece Agatha (Telma Crisanti) at the video store where she works, they disagree over which kind of films are quality films. Tellez complains in particular about how formulaic romantic comedies are. Then, much like the characters in the original &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), after discussing the rules of the genre, Tellez finds himself bound by those same rules – when he gets involved with a beautiful young woman.While searching for a new apartment, he meets Sophie (Dolores Fonzi), a very desirable woman who&#39;s very different from him, especially when it comes to her taste in movies. He keeps running into her throughout the city (as in 1989&#39;s &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;) and they start to date. It&#39;s pretty funny seeing the jaded Tellez work his way through the rules of the rom-com, and hearing portions of his internal monologue adds to the humor of his situation. Through his relationship with Sophie, the influence of Agatha and the experience of writing a screenplay which becomes a romantic comedy, his perspective changes. However, in spite of Tellez&#39; life beginning to follow a typical rom-com pattern, he also learns that the rules can be broken.&quot;The Film Critic&quot; is a clever self-referential meditation on love in the modern world, but could have gotten more out of its premise. The film takes a little too long to get to Tellez&#39; relationship with Sophie. Late in the movie, the story takes a sudden turn into a dramatic subplot that seems like a distraction from what the movie is really about – and is then dropped with no follow-up. Fonzi makes Sophie a pleasure to watch, but inadvertently calls attention to her co-star&#39;s lack of charisma. It&#39;s too bad that this film couldn&#39;t deliver on the promise of its central idea more effectively and for a larger percentage of the film, because when it&#39;s focused on what makes it special, it&#39;s tough to criticize.

Last season&#39;s first episode also started off great but I think this first episode outdid that one.There was a point in time, from season 3-5 where the first episode was filler but I am glad that, that is not the case anymore.The animation in this episode was great in my opinion, very fluid and no still frames. I am optimistic in seeing this continue throughout the season and being one of the better animated seasons of MHA! I am super excited for this season as the trailer hinted at many moments to be excited for.","As jailbreakers run rampant in Japan, Star and Stripe flies from the U.S. to Japan to help and finds Shigaraki waiting for her in the middle of her flight path.As jailbreakers run rampant in Japan, Star and Stripe flies from the U.S. to Japan to help and finds Shigaraki waiting for her in the middle of her flight path.",,"tt31107434"
